# 🗂️ FileSense - Smart File Organizer

## 🔍 Overview

Tired of your Downloads folder looking like a digital junkyard , random PDFs, reports, screenshots, and JSONs all over?  
**FileSense** is an AI-powered local file organizer that sorts documents **by meaning**, not just by name or type.

It uses **SentenceTransformers** and **FAISS** to understand what each file *means*, then moves it into the right folder automatically.  
For scanned documents, it even uses **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to read text from images and classify them correctly.

## ⚙️ Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Semantic Sorting** | Understands file content instead of just names using transformer embeddings. |
| ⚡ **FAISS Indexing** | Builds a fast semantic search index for folder labels. |
| 👀 **OCR Fallback** | Extracts text from scanned or image-based PDFs using `pdfplumber + pytesseract`. |
| 🧩 **Keyword Boosting** | Gives small weight bonuses for subject-specific terms (like "newton", "sql", "essay", etc). |
| 🧵 **Multithreading** | Handles multiple files simultaneously for faster performance. |
| 🕵️ **Real-time Watcher** | Detects and organizes files automatically as soon as new ones appear. |
| 🖥️ **GUI Launcher** | Desktop interface with start/stop controls, logs, and tray icon. |
| 🔒 **Offline Privacy** | Works entirely offline — nothing leaves your device. |

## 🔬 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Create the FAISS Index (`create_index.py`)

- Reads folder names and descriptions from `folder_labels.json`.
- Enriches descriptions with extra keywords for better context.
- Uses **SentenceTransformer (`all-mpnet-base-v2`)** to encode them.
- Builds a FAISS index for fast similarity lookups.

```bash
python create_index.py
```
> Output: `folder_embeddings.faiss` + updated `folder_labels.json`

---

### 2️⃣ Process Files in Bulk (`script.py`)

- Scans your target folder (default: `./files`)
- For each file:
  - Extracts text via PDF/DOCX/TXT/OCR.
  - Encodes the text and finds the best-matching folder embedding.
  - If similarity ≥ 0.45 (default threshold), moves it there.
  - Otherwise, falls back to keyword matches.

**Supports multithreading** via `multhread.py`:
```bash
python script.py --dir ./files --threads 8
```

---

### 3️⃣ Watch Folder in Real-time (`watcher_script.py`)

Automatically monitors a directory and sorts files as soon as they appear.

```bash
python watcher_script.py --dir ./files
```

Uses `watchdog` to detect file creation events and passes each new file to `process_file()`.

---

### 4️⃣ Launch with GUI (`launcher.py`)

Tired of the terminal? FileSense includes a full desktop launcher with buttons, logs, and tray control.

- Start/Stop the main processor (`script.py`)
- Start/Stop the real-time watcher
- View live logs directly in the window
- Minimize to system tray and keep running in the background

Run it like this:
```bash
python launcher.py
```

---

## 🧩 Configuration Options

| Setting | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `--dir` / `-d` | script.py / watcher_script.py | Directory to scan or watch. |
| `--threads` / `-t` | script.py | Maximum number of concurrent threads. |
| `THRESHOLD` | process_file.py | Minimum similarity to accept match (default 0.45). |
| `MODEL_NAME` | create_index.py | SentenceTransformer model (default: `all-mpnet-base-v2`). |

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- faiss-cpu
- sentence-transformers
- numpy
- pdfplumber
- pytesseract + Pillow
- python-docx
- watchdog
- pystray (for launcher GUI)

### Install All
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy pdfplumber pytesseract pillow python-docx watchdog pystray
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr   # (Linux)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahhyoushh/filesense.git
cd filesense
```

2. Edit `folder_labels.json` to define your folder names and descriptions.

3. Create the FAISS index:
```bash
python create_index.py
```

4. Drop unorganized files into `/files` and run:
```bash
python script.py
```
or
```bash
python launcher.py
```

## 💡 Future Plans

- Faster embedding caching
- Incremental FAISS updates (no full rebuild needed)
- Better classification for image-only documents
- Undo/recovery feature for moved files
- Auto-renaming using extracted metadata
- Simple web dashboard for previews and control

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Natural Language Embeddings:** how to use `SentenceTransformer` for semantic similarity tasks.  
- **FAISS Indexing:** building a local vector database for fast nearest-neighbor searches.  
- **Threading:** managing concurrent file operations without blocking I/O.  
- **OCR Processing:** extracting readable text from scanned or image-only PDFs.  
- **Automation with Watchdog:** event-driven file monitoring in real time.  
- **GUI Development:** building a full-featured Python launcher with Tkinter and pystray.  
- **Modular Architecture:** clean separation between data prep, processing, and user interaction layers.

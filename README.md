# File Organizer

A simple Python project that automatically **organizes your downloaded files** into folders based on their content and labels. Designed for anyone whoâ€™s too lazy to sort their downloads manually .

It reads file names and extracts relevant data, combines them into a descriptive format, and uses similarity metrics to group files into the right folders. Works for JSON, text, and other structured file types, making your downloads neat and easy to navigate.

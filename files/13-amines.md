### Can you recall ?
*   Write some examples of nitrogen containing organic compounds.
*   What are the types of amines?

---

Amines are nitrogen containing organic compounds having basic character. Amines are present in many natural compounds like proteins, vitamins, hormones and plant products like nicotine.

**13.1 Classification of Amines :** Amines are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°) and tertiary (3°) amines. Their structures are obtained in simple way by replacing one, two or three hydrogen atoms of NH₃ molecule by alkyl/aryl groups (see Table 13.1).

Secondary and tertiary amines are further classified as simple / symmetrical amines and mixed / unsymmetrical amines. When all the alkyl or aryl groups on nitrogen are same, it is a simple amine. If these groups are different, then the amine is a mixed amine.

Amines are also divided into two major classes, namely, aliphatic and aromatic amines on the basis of nature of the groups attached to the nitrogen atom.

### Use your brain power
Classify the following amines as simple/mixed; 1º, 2º, 3º and aliphatic or aromatic.

(C₂H₅)₂NH, (CH₃)₃N, C₂H₅-NH-CH₃,

CH₃-CH(CH₃)-NH₂, C₂H₅-NH-C₆H₅,

CH₃-C(CH₃)₂-NH₂, C₆H₅-N(CH₃)₂, C₆H₅-N⁺O⁻

---

### Remember...
Other organic compounds like alkyl halides or alcohols are classified as 1º, 2º, 3º depending upon the nature of the carbon atom to which functional group is attached where as amines are classified depending upon the number of alkyl or aryl groups directly attached to the nitrogen atom. Thus, isopropyl amine is 1º amine, but isopropyl alcohol is 2º alcohol.

## 13.2 Nomenclature of Amines :

**13.2.1 Common names:** Common names of aliphatic amines are given by writing the name of alkyl group followed by suffix-amine, that is, 'alkyl amine'. In the case of mixed amines, the names of alkyl groups are written in alphabetical order. If two or three identical alkyl groups are attached to nitrogen atom, the prefix 'di-' or 'tri-' is added before the name of alkyl group. The parent arylamine, C₆H₅-NH₂, is named as aniline. Other aromatic amines are named as derivatives of aniline (see Table 13.2).

**13.2.2 IUPAC names:** In IUPAC system, primary amines are named by replacing the ending 'e' of the parent alkane by suffix -amine (alkanamine). A locant indicating the position of amino group is added before the suffix amine. When two or more amino groups are present, the prefix ‘di-', 'tri-' etc. are used with proper locant. In this case the ending ‘e’ of parent alkane is retained.

Secondary or tertiary amines are named as N-substituted derivatives of primary amines. The largest alkyl group attached to nitrogen is taken as the parent alkane and other alkyl groups as N-substituents. While naming arylamines ending ‘e' of arene is replaced by 'amine'. The common name of aniline is also accepted by IUPAC (see Table 13.2).

## 13.3 Preparation of Amines :

**13.3.1 : By ammonolysis of alkyl halides :**

When alkyl halide is heated with alcoholic solution of excess ammonia it undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the halogen atom is replaced by an amino (-NH₂) group to form primary amine. This process of breaking of C-X bond by ammonia is known as ammonolysis. The reaction is also known as alkylation of ammonia. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373 K. It may be noted that the primary amine obtained in the 1st step is stronger nucleophile than ammonia. Hence, it further reacts with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary amines and finally quaternary ammonium salt if NH₃ is not used in large excess.

R-X + NH₃(alc). (excess) --Δ--> R-NH₂ (1º amine)

The order of reactivity of alkyl halides with ammonia is R-I > R-Br > R-Cl.

### Do you know ?
When tert-butyl bromide is treated with alcoholic NH₃, isobutylene is formed. This is the result of elimination reaction preferred over nucleophilic substitution through the stable tertiary butyl carbocation intermediate.
CH₃-C(Br)(CH₃)-CH₃ (tert-Butyl bromide) --NH₃(alc)--> [-Br⁻] CH₃-C⁺(CH₃)-CH₃ --(-H⁺)--> CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₃ (isobutylene)

---

**Solution:** Methyl bromide can be converted into ethyl amine in two stage reaction sequence as shown below.
CH₃-Br + KCN → CH₃-CN + KBr
CH₃-CN --Na/C₂H₅OH (reduction)--> CH₃-CH₂-NH₂
The starting compound methyl bromide contains one carbon atom while the product ethylamine contains two carbon atoms. A reaction in which number of carbons increases involves a step up reaction. The overall conversion of methyl bromide into ethyl amine is a step up conversion.

---

**13.3.2 Reduction of nitrocompounds :**

Aliphatic and aromatic nitrocompounds can be reduced to primary amines by using metal-acid mixture (Sn/HCl or Fe/HCl or Zn/HCl) or catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Ni or Pt or Pd) or LiAlH₄ in ether.

R-NO₂ + 6[H] --Sn/HCl--> R-NH₂ + 2H₂O

**13.3.3 Reduction of alkyl cyanide (alkanenitriles) :**

### Can you recall?
*   How is alkyl halide converted into alkyl cyanide ?

Primary amines can be obtained by the reduction of alkyl cyanide with sodium and ethanol. This is known as **Mendius reduction**. The reaction can also be brought about by lithium aluminium hydride.

R-C≡N + 4[H] --Na/C₂H₅OH or LiAlH₄--> R-CH₂-NH₂ (1° amine)

---

**13.3.4 By reduction of amides :**

Primary amines having same number of carbon atoms can be obtained by the reduction of amides by LiAlH₄ in ether or by Na/C₂H₅OH.

CH₃-C(=O)-NH₂ (Acetamide) + 4[H] --LiAlH₄,ether/H₃O⁺ or Na/C₂H₅OH--> CH₃-CH₂-NH₂ (Ethylamine) + H₂O

**13.3.5 Gabriel phthalimide synthesis:** This method is used for the synthesis of primary amine. It involves the following three stages.
i. Formation of potassium salt of phthalimide from phthalimide on reaction with alcoholic potassium hydroxide.
ii. Formation of N-alkyl phthalimide from the potassium salt by reaction with alkyl halide.
iii. Alkaline hydrolysis of N-alkyl phthalimide to form the corresponding primary amine.

---
<div align="center">285</div>

---
---

i. Phthalimide reacting with alcoholic KOH loses water to form Potassium phthalimide.
[Image of the reaction: Phthalimide, a bicyclic compound with a benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring containing an imide group (C(=O)-NH-C(=O)), reacts with alc. KOH. The H from the N-H bond is removed, and K⁺ takes its place, forming a salt, Potassium Phthalimide. Water is a byproduct.]

ii. Potassium phthalimide reacts with an alkyl halide (R-X) to form N-Alkylphthalimide.
[Image of the reaction: Potassium phthalimide (N⁻K⁺) reacts with R-X. The K⁺ and X⁻ ions leave as KX, and the R group attaches to the nitrogen atom, forming N-Alkylphthalimide.]

iii. N-Alkylphthalimide undergoes alkaline hydrolysis with aqueous NaOH.
[Image of the reaction: N-Alkylphthalimide reacts with NaOH(aq), breaking the two C-N bonds in the imide ring. This forms sodium phthalate (a benzene ring with two adjacent -COO⁻Na⁺ groups) and a primary amine (R-NH₂).]

Aromatic amines cannot be prepared by this method because aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by phthalimide.

**13.3.6 By Hofmann degradation (Hofmann rearrangement / Hofmann bromamide degradation / Hofmann hypobromite degradation):**

This is a good laboratory method for the conversion of an amide into primary amine containing one carbon less. The reaction is brought about by warming the amide with bromine and concentrated aqueous KOH solution.

R-C(=O)-NH₂ (Amide) + Br₂ + 4KOH(aq) --Δ--> R-NH₂ (1° amine) + 2KBr + K₂CO₃ + 2H₂O

For example :
CH₃-C(=O)-NH₂ (Acetamide) + Br₂ + 4KOH (aq) --Δ--> CH₃-NH₂ (methylamine) + 2KBr + K₂CO₃ + 2H₂O

The overall result is removal of the -C(=O)- group from the amide. As the product contains one carbon atom less than the original amide. It is a **step down** reaction.

## 13.4 Physical properties of Amines :

**13.4.1 Intermolecular forces, boiling points and solubility:** The N-H bond in amines is polar because the electronegativities of Nitrogen (3.0) and Hydrogen (2.1) are different. Due to the polar nature of N-H bond primary and secondary amines have intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding is to greater extent in primary amine than in secondary amines, because primary amines have two hydrogen atoms bonded to nitrogen for hydrogen bond formation (see Fig 13.1).

**Fig. 13.1: Intermolecular hydrogen bonding in primary amines**
[Image description: A diagram showing hydrogen bonds (dotted lines) between three primary amine (R-NH₂) molecules. The nitrogen atom (δ⁻) of one molecule forms a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen atom (δ⁺) from the N-H bond of another molecule. The diagram explicitly shows the partial positive charge on hydrogen and partial negative charge on nitrogen, like R-N(δ⁻)-H(δ⁺), and the hydrogen bond as H(δ⁺)···N(δ⁻).]

Tertiary amines do not have intermolecular hydrogen bonding as there is no hydrogen atom on nitrogen of tertiary amine. But due to polar N-C bonds, tertiary amines are polar molecules, and have intermolecular dipole-dipole attractive forces. Thus intermolecular forces of attraction are strongest in primary amines and weakest in tertiary amines.

---
<div align="center">286</div>

---
---

The observed order of boiling points of isomeric amines is : primary amine > secondary amine > tertiary amine (see Table 13.3 serial numbers 1, 2, 3). It can be explained on the basis of the intermolecular forces in them.

The lower aliphatic amines are gases with fishy odour, middle members are liquids and higher members are solids under ordinary temperature and pressure.

Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless liquids but get coloured as they are easily oxidised by air.

Due to their ability to form hydrogen bond with water molecule, lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water (see Fig. 13.2). Solubility of amines decreases with increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of hydrophobic alkyl group. Aromatic amines and higher aliphatic amines are insoluble in water.

**Fig. 13.2: Hydrogen bonding between amine and water molecule**
[Image description: A diagram showing hydrogen bonding between a primary amine molecule (H-N(H)-H) and two water molecules (H-O-H). A hydrogen atom from the amine is hydrogen-bonded to the oxygen of one water molecule (H···O). The nitrogen atom of the amine is hydrogen-bonded to a hydrogen atom of another water molecule (N:···H). Partial charges (δ⁺ and δ⁻) are shown on the atoms.]

Since N-H bonds in amines are less polar than O-H bond in alcohol, water solubilities of alcohols, amines and alkanes of comparable molar mass in water are in the decreasing order: **alcohols > amines > alkanes**.

The order of boiling points of alkanes, amines, alcohols and carboxylic acid of comparable molar mass is as follows :
**Alkanes < Amines < Alcohols < Carboxylic acid.** (Table 13.3, serial number 4, 5, 6, 7)

## 13.5 Basicity of Amines

The basic nature of amines is due to presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. In terms of Lewis theory, amines are bases because they can share a lone pair of electrons on 'N' atom with an electron deficient species. For example : Trimethylamine shares its lone pair of electrons with the electron deficient boron trifluoride.
Me₃N: + BF₃ → Me₃N⁺-BF₃⁻

Basic strength of amines is expressed quantitatively as K_b or pK_b value. In terms of Lowry-Bronsted theory, the basic nature of amines is explained by writing the following equilibrium.

≡N: + H₂O ⇌ ≡N⁺-H + OH⁻ ........ (13.1)
(amine) (conjugate acid)

In this equilibrium amine accepts H⁺, hence an amine is a Lowry-Bronsted base. For stronger base, this equilibrium shifts towards right, thereby the K_b value is larger and pK_b value is smaller and vice versa (refer to Chapter 3). Table 13.4 gives pK_b values of some amines.

| N-Methylmethanamine | (CH₃)₂NH | 3.27 |
| N-Ethylethanamine | (CH₃CH₂)₂NH | 3.00 |
| **Tertiary alkanamines :** | | |
| N, N-Dimethylmethanamine | (CH₃)₃N | 4.22 |
| N, N-Diethylethanamine | (CH₃CH₂)₃N | 3.25 |
| **Ammonia** | NH₃ | 4.75 |
| **Arylamines :** | | |
| Benzenamine (aniline) | C₆H₅-NH₂ | 9.38 |
| N-Methylaniline | C₆H₅-NHCH₃ | 9.30 |
| N, N-Dimethylaniline | C₆H₅-N(CH₃)₂ | 8.92 |

---

**13.5.1 : Basic strength of aliphatic amines :**

The trend in the observed pK_b values (see table 13.4) and basic strength of 1º, 2º, 3º amines and NH₃ can be represented as shown below:
Order of pK_b values:
NH₃ > R-NH₂ > R₂NH < R₃N

Order of basic strength :
NH₃ < R-NH₂ < R₂NH > R₃N ............ (13.2)

Thus as per the observed pK_b values of the aliphatic amines, **secondary amines are the strongest bases.** Basic strength increases as we move from NH₃ to R-NH₂ and from R-NH₂ to R₂NH, but basic strength decreases as we move from R₂NH to R₃N (Table 13.4).

The basic strength and the corresponding pK_b value depends upon the position of the equilibrium shown in Eq. (13.1). Greater the stabilization of the conjugate acid more on right side the equilibrium will lie and stronger will be the base and smaller will be its pK_b value.

---

### Can you recall ?
*   What is meant by +I effect ?
*   Which of the following species is better stabilized and by which effect ?
CH₃-CH₂⁺ and CH₃-CH⁺-CH₃

Basicity of amines is related to the structural effects which influence stabilization of various species. Greater is the stabilization of the protonated amine, that is, the conjugate acid, greater is the basicity of the amine.

### Use your brain power
Refer to pK_b values from Table 13.4 and answer which compound from the following pairs is stronger base ?
i. CH₃-NH₂ and (CH₃)₂NH
ii. (C₂H₅)₂NH and (C₂H₅)₃N
iii. NH₃ and (CH₃)₂CH-NH₂

<div align="center">288</div>

---

**a. Influence of +I effect** on stabilization of conjugate acids of aliphatic amines and NH₃ can be represented as shown below :
H-N⁺H₃ < R-N⁺H₃ < R₂N⁺H₂ < R₃N⁺H

An alkyl group exerts electron releasing inductive effect (+I) which stabilizes positive charge on atom bonded to it. As we move from conjugate acid of ammonia (NH₄⁺) to that of tertiary amine (R₃NH⁺), the number of alkyl groups (R) bonded to Nitrogen goes on increasing steadily. This results in increasing stabilization of the conjugate acids and thereby an increasing order of basic strength is expected.

Order of stabilization :
NH₄⁺ < R-NH₃⁺ < R₂NH₂⁺ < R₃N⁺H

Expected order of basic strength :
NH₃ < R-NH₂ < R₂NH < R₃N

The expected order of basic strength on the basis of +I effect differs from the observed order (Eq.13.2). It is seen that the observed increasing basic strength from ammonia to 1º amine and from 1° amine to 2º amine is explained on the basis of increased stabilization of conjugate acids by +I effect of increased number of alkyl (R) groups. However, decreased basic strength of 3° amine implies that the conjugate acid of 3° amine is less stabilized even though the +I effect of three alkyl groups in R₃NH⁺ is expected to be large. This is suggestive of existance of another influencing factor in stabilization of conjugate acids of amines.

**b. Influence of solvation by water** on stabilization of conjugate acids of aliphatic amines and ammonia can be represented as shown below :
[Image description: Four diagrams showing the solvation of ammonium and substituted ammonium ions by water molecules.
1. NH₄⁺ is shown with four H-O-H molecules hydrogen-bonded to its four hydrogen atoms.
2. RNH₃⁺ is shown with three H-O-H molecules hydrogen-bonded to its three hydrogen atoms.
3. R₂NH₂⁺ is shown with two H-O-H molecules hydrogen-bonded to its two hydrogen atoms.
4. R₃NH⁺ is shown with one H-O-H molecule hydrogen-bonded to its one hydrogen atom.]

The solvent water stabilizes the conjugate acid by hydrogen bonding through the 'H’ bonded to the 'N⁺'. The number of 'H' atoms bonded to the 'N⁺' decreaes from 4 in NH₄⁺ to 1 in R₃NH⁺. As a result NH₄⁺ is best stabilized by solvation while the stabilization by solvation is very poor in R₃NH⁺.

**c. Combined influence** of +I effect and solvation on stabilization if conjugate acids of aliphatic amines decides the observed basic strength and pK_b value. These two influencing factors operate in opposite directions.

[Image description: A diagram showing two opposing trends.
- From NH₄⁺ to RNH₃⁺ to R₂NH₂⁺ to R₃NH⁺, an arrow points right labelled "increases" under the heading "Solvation".
- From NH₄⁺ to RNH₃⁺ to R₂NH₂⁺ to R₃NH⁺, another arrow points right labelled "increases" under the heading "+I effect".]

The net results is that as we move from NH₃ to RNH₂ to R₂NH, the basic strength increases due to better stabilization of the corresponding conjugate acids. But 3° amine is weaker base than 2° amine because the stabilization of conjugate acid of 3º amine by solvation is very poor.

**13.5.2 Basicity of arylamines :**

### Can you recall ?
Refer to Table 13.4 and answer :
Are the pK_b values of aniline, N-methylaniline and N, N-dimethylaniline larger or smaller than those of NH₃ and CH₃NH₂ ?
Which one of the two, aniline or CH₃NH₂, is a stronger base ?

---
<div align="center">289</div>

---
---

From the pK_b values we understand that arylamines in general are weaker bases than ammonia and aliphatic amines. Strength of arylamines is explained in accordance with Lowery Bronsted theory by writing the following equilibrium (Eq. 13.3) For aniline (similar to eq. 13.1).
C₆H₅-NH₂ (Base) + H₂O ⇌ C₆H₅-NH₃⁺ (Conjugate acid) + OH⁻ ...... (13.3)

Here, both the species base and conjugate acid, are resonance stabilized but to different extent.

In arylamines, the -NH₂ group is attached directly to an aromatic ring. The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is conjugated to the aromatic ring and is less available for protonation. Aniline is resonance stabilized by the following five resonance structures.
[Image description: Five resonance structures of aniline.
(I) The standard structure of aniline (C₆H₅-NH₂).
(II) The lone pair on nitrogen forms a double bond with the adjacent carbon of the ring, pushing the pi electrons to the ortho carbon, which gets a negative charge. The nitrogen becomes positively charged (C₆H₄=NH₂⁺).
(III) The negative charge moves to the para position.
(IV) The negative charge moves to the other ortho position.
(V) The negative charge moves back to the carbon adjacent to nitrogen, and the C=N double bond breaks, restoring the lone pair to nitrogen. This is similar to (I) but with pi bonds in the ring shifted.]

On the other hand anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton does not have lone pair of electrons on nitrogen. Hence it can be stabilized by only two resonance structures and therefore less stabilized than aniline.
[Image description: Two resonance structures of the anilinium ion (C₆H₅-NH₃⁺).
(I) The standard structure with the positive charge on the nitrogen atom.
(II) A Kekulé structure showing the pi bonds in a different position.]

As a result the equilibrium (13.3) is shifted towards left side. This makes aniline (and also other arylamines) weaker bases than aliphatic amines and ammonia.

## 13.6 Chemical properties of amines
**13.6.1 Laboratory test for amines :**

**a. Test for amines as the 'base':** All amines 1º, 2º and 3° are basic compounds. Aqueous solution of water soluble amines turns red litmus blue.
The 'basic' nature of amines is detected in laboratory by reaction with aqueous solution of strong mineral acid HCl.
>N: (amine) + HCl(aq) → >N⁺-H(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) (a substituted ammonium chloride)
>N⁺-H(aq)+ Cl⁻(aq) + NaOH(aq) (excess) → >N: + NaCl(aq) + H₂O

Water insoluble amine dissolves in aqueous HCl due to formation of water soluble substituted ammonium chloride, which on reaction with excess aqueous NaOH regenerates the original insoluble amine.

**b. Diazotization reaction/ Orange dye test:** In a sample of aromatic primary amine, 1-2 mL of conc. HCl is added. The aqueous solution of NaNO₂ is added with cooling. This solution is transfered to a test tube containing solution of β naphthol in NaOH. Formation of orange dye indicates presence of aromatic primary amino group. (It may be noted that temperature of all the solutions and reaction mixtures is maintined near 0°C throughout the reaction).

<div align="center">290</div>

The reactions involved in this test will be discussed in section 13.7.2.

**13.6.2: Alkylation of amines : Hofmann's exhaustive alkylation :** When a primary amine is heated with excess of primary alkyl halide it gives a mixture of secondary amine, tertiary amine along with tetraalkylammonium halide (also refer to sec. 13.3.1).
R-NH₂ (1° Amine) --R-X--> R₂NH (2° Amine) --R-X--> R₃N (3° Amine) --R-X--> R₄N⁺X⁻ (Tetraalkyl ammonium halide)

If excess of alkyl halide is used tetraalkyl ammonium halide is obtained as major product. The reaction is known as exhaustive alkylation of amines.

The tetraalkylammonium halides are called quaternary ammonium salts which are crystalline solids. They are the derivatives of ammoium salts in which all the four hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen in NH₄⁺ are replaced by four alkyl groups (same or different). Primary, secondary and tertiary amines consume three, two and one moles of alkyl halide respectively to get converted into quaternary ammonium salt. The reaction is carried out in presence of mild base NaHCO₃ to neutralize the large quantity of HX formed. If the alkyl halide is methyl iodide, the reaction is called exhaustive methylation of amines.

For example: When methylamine is heated with excess methyl iodide, it gives tetramethyl ammonium iodide.
CH₃-NH₂ + CH₃-I --Δ--> (CH₃)₂NH + HI
(CH₃)₂NH + CH₃-I --Δ--> (CH₃)₃N + HI
(CH₃)₃N + CH₃-I --Δ--> (CH₃)₄N⁺I⁻

---

**13.6.3 Hofmann Elimination :**
When tetraalkylammonium halide is hetated with moist silver oxide, it gives quanternary ammonium hydroxide which is a deliquescent crystalline solid, and strongly basic like NaOH or KOH. Quaternary ammonium hydroxides on strong heating undergo β-elimination to give an alkene, the reaction is called Hofmann elimination. The least substituted alkene is obtained as major product (in contrast to Saytzeff elimination)
For example :

## 13.6.4 Acylation of amines :

### Can you recall ?
*   What is an acyl group ?
*   How are alcohols acylated ?

Aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines undergo acylation reaction. These amines contain replaceable hydrogen atoms (positively polarised H) on the nitrogen atom. These hydrogen atoms are replaced by acyl groups such as acetyl group. On reaction of amines with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride, acetyl derivative of amine is obtained. It is also called amide. Amide is less basic than the amine. Acylation is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The reaction is carried out in presence of strong base like pyridine, which neutralizes the acid produced during the reaction. For example :
(i) C₂H₅-NH(H) (Ethanamine) + CH₃-C(=O)Cl (Ethanoyl chloride) --Pyridine--> C₂H₅-N(H)-C(=O)-CH₃ (N-Ethylethanamide) + HCl
(ii) C₆H₅-N(CH₃)H (N-Methylaniline) + CH₃-C(=O)Cl --Pyridine--> C₆H₅-N(CH₃)-C(=O)-CH₃ (N-methyl-N-phenylethanamide) + HCl

Benzoyl chloride also gives similar reaction with amines.

## 13.6.6 Reaction with nitrous acid :
Primary, secondary and tertiary amines react differently with nitrous acid. Reactions of only primary amines will be considered here.

### Can you tell?
*   What is the formula of nitrous acid ?
*   Can nitrous acid be stored in bottle ?

Nitrous acid is an unstable compound. Hence it is prepared *in situ* by adding aqueous sodium nitrite to hydrochloric acid already mix with the substrate, that is amine.

**a. Aliphatic primary amines** on reaction with nitrous acid form aliphatic diazonium salts as very unstable intermidiates which decompose immediately by reaction with solvent water. Corresponding alcohol is formed as the product of the reaction and nitrogen gas is liberated.
R-NH₂ + HNO₂ --(273-278 K, NaNO₂+HCl)--> [R-N₂⁺Cl⁻] (alkyl diazonium chloride) --H₂O--> R-OH + N₂↑ + HCl

**b. Aromatic primary amines** react with nitrous acid to form diazonium salts which have reasonable stability at 273 K.
C₆H₅-NH₂ + HNO₂ --(273-278 K, NaNO₂+HCl)--> C₆H₅-N₂⁺Cl⁻ (benzene diazonium chloride)

## 13.7 Reactions of arene diazonium salts:
Aryl diazonium salts show two types of reactions.

**13.7.1 Reactions involving displacement of diazo group:** The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is a very good leaving group due to the positive charge on nitrogen atom bonded to aromatic ring. As a result, the arene diazonium salts undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction with a variety of nucleophiles. Table 13.5 shows reactions of diazonium salts involving displacement of diazo group.

**Table 13.5 Reactions of arene diazonium salts**

| **Sandmeyer reaction** (good yield) | Ar-N₂⁺X⁻ | CuCl/HCl | Ar-Cl+N₂ |
| | Ar-N₂⁺X⁻ | CuBr/HBr | Ar-Br+N₂ |
| | Ar-N₂⁺X⁻ | CuCN/KCN | Ar-CN+N₂ |
| **Gatterman reaction** | Ar-N₂⁺X⁻ | Cu powder/HCl | Ar-Cl+N₂ |
| | Ar-N₂⁺X⁻ | Cu powder/HBr | Ar-Br+N₂ |

| **Phenol formation** | Ar-N₂⁺Cl⁻ | H₂O/283 K | Ar-OH+N₂+HCl |

**Reaction with fluoroboric acid :**
Arene diazonium salt on reaction with fluoroboric acid gives precipitate of diazonium fluoroborate which on heating decomposes to yield fluoroarene. On the other hand when heated with aqueous sodium nitrite in presence of copper it gives nitroarene.

**13.7.2 Reactions involving retention of diazo group: (Coupling reactions) :**

Arene diazonium salts when treated with certain reactive aromatic compounds such as phenols or aromatic amines, give azo compounds. These have extended conjugated system of double bonds in which two aromatic rings are joined through azo group -N=N-. This reaction is called **azo coupling**. Azo compounds are brightly coloured and are used as dyes. This is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. Here the electrophiles are positively charged diazonium ions. Substitution usually occurs para to the ring activating group. For example : Benzenediazonium chloride reacts with phenol in mild alkaline medium to give p-Hydroxy-azobenzene (orange dye).
C₆H₅-N₂⁺Cl⁻ (Benzenediazonium chloride) + C₆H₅OH (Phenol) --OH⁻--> C₆H₅-N=N-C₆H₄-OH (p-Hydroxyazobenzene) + HCl

Azo coupling with β-naphthol in NaOH is used as a confirmatory test for primary aromatic amines. Benzenediazonium chloride reacts with aniline in mild alkaline medium to give p-aminoazo-benzene (yellow dye.)
C₆H₅-N₂⁺Cl⁻ (Benzenediazonium chloride) + C₆H₅NH₂ (Aniline) --OH⁻--> C₆H₅-N=N-C₆H₄-NH₂ (p-Aminoazobenzene) + HCl

## 13.8 Reaction with arenesulfonyl chloride :
(**Hinsberg's test**) : Benzenesulfonyl chloride (C₆H₅SO₂Cl) is known as **Hinsberg's reagent.**

**a. Ethyl amine** (primary amine) reacts with benzenesulfonyl chloride to form N-ethyl benzenesulfonyl amide.
C₆H₅-S(=O)₂-Cl (Benzenesulfonyl chloride) + H-N(H)-C₂H₅ (1° amine) → C₆H₅-S(=O)₂-N(H)-C₂H₅ (N-Ethylbenzene sulfonamide) (Soluble in alkali) + HCl
The hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulfonamide ethanamine (a primary amine) is strongly acidic. Hence it is soluble in alkali.

**b. Diethyl amine** reacts with benzene-sulfonyl chloride to give N, N- diethyl benzene sulfonamide.
C₆H₅-S(=O)₂-Cl + H-N(C₂H₅)₂ (2° amine) → C₆H₅-S(=O)₂-N(C₂H₅)₂ (N, N-diethylbenzene sulfonamide) + HCl
N,N-diethylbenzenesulfonamide does not contain any H-atom attached to nitrogen atom. Hence it is not acidic and does not dissolve in alkali.

## 13.9 Electrophilic aromatic substitution in aromatic amines :
Amino group is ortho and para directing and powerful ring activating group. As a result aromtic amines readily undergo electrophilic substitution reactions.

**a. Bromination :** Aniline reacts with bromine water at room temperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6- tribromoaniline.
C₆H₅NH₂ (Aniline) + 3Br₂ --Br₂/H₂O--> C₆H₂(Br)₃NH₂ (2,4,6-tribromoaniline) + 3HBr

---
<div align="center">294</div>

---
---

**Problem 13.1 :** Write the scheme for preparation of p-bromoaniline from aniline. Justify your answer.

**Solution :** NH₂- group in aniline is highly ring activating and o-/p- directing due to involvement of the lone pair of electrons on 'N' in resonace with the ring. As a result, on reaction with Br₂ it gives 2,4,6-tribromoniline. To get a monobromo product, it is necessary to decrease the ring activating effect of -NH₂ group. This is done by acetylation of aniline. The lone pair of 'N' in acetanilide is also involved in resonance in the acetyl group. To that extent ring activation decreases.
[Resonance structures of acetanilide shown: O⁻-C(NH-C₆H₅)=CH₃ ↔ O=C(N⁺H-C₆H₅)-CH₃]
Hence, acetanilide on bromination gives a monobromo product p-bromoacetanilide. After monobromination the original -NH₂ group is regenerated. The protection of -NH₂ group in the form of acetyl group is removed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis to get p-bromoaniline, as shown in the following scheme.
C₆H₅-NH₂ (Aniline) --(CH₃CO)₂O or CH₃COCl/base--> C₆H₅-NH-CO-CH₃ (Acetanilide) --Br₂/(Acetic acid solvent)--> p-Br-C₆H₄-NH-CO-CH₃ (p-bromoacetanilide) --hydrolysis/H⁺--> p-Br-C₆H₄-NH₂ (p-bromoaniline)

**b. Nitration :** Direct nitration of aniline yeilds a mixture of ortho, meta and para nitroanilines. In acidic medium -NH₂ group is protonated to -NH₃⁺ group which is meta-directing and deactivating. Hence considerable amount of m-nitroaniline is obtained.
C₆H₅-NH₂ (Aniline) --Conc. HNO₃ + Conc H₂SO₄, 288 K-->
o-NO₂-C₆H₄-NH₂ (o-nitroaniline) (2%) +
m-NO₂-C₆H₄-NH₂ (m-nitroaniline) (47%) +
p-NO₂-C₆H₄-NH₂ (p-nitroaniline) (51%)

---

### Internet my friend
Search the pK_a or pK_b values of ortho, meta and para nitroaniline on internet and arrange them in increasing order of their basic strength.

---

However, to get p-nitroaniline as major product, -NH₂ group is first protected by acetylation, nitration is carried out and then amide is hydrolysed.
C₆H₅-NH₂ (Aniline) --(CH₃CO)₂O/Pyridine--> C₆H₅-NH-CO-CH₃ (Acetanilide) --Conc. HNO₃ + Conc H₂SO₄, 288K--> p-NO₂-C₆H₄-NH-CO-CH₃ (p-nitroacetanilide) --H⁺ or OH⁻--> p-NO₂-C₆H₄-NH₂ (p-nitroaniline)

**c. Sulfonation :** Aniline reacts with concerntrated sulfuric acid to form anilinium hydrogen sulfate which on heating with sulfuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulfonic acid (sulfanilic acid) as major product.

---
<div align="center">295</div>

C₆H₅-NH₂ (Aniline) --H₂SO₄--> C₆H₅-NH₃⁺HSO₄⁻ (Anilinium hydrogensulfate) --453-473 K--> p-NH₂-C₆H₄-SO₃H (Sulfanilic acid) ⇌ p-NH₃⁺-C₆H₄-SO₃⁻ (Zwitter ion)

Sulfanilic acid exists as a salt; called **dipolar ion** or **zwitter ion**. It is produced by the reaction between an acidic group and a basic group present in the same molecule.

Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms. Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection.

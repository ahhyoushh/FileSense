An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions. Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes.

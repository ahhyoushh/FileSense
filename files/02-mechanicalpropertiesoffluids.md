## 2.1 Introduction:
In XIth Std. we discussed the behaviour of solids under the action of a force. Among three states of matter, i.e., solid, liquid and gas, a solid nearly maintains its fixed shape and volume even if a large force is applied to it. Liquids and gases do not have their own shape and they take the shape of the containing vessel. Due to this, liquids and gases flow under the action of external force. A *fluid means a substance that can flow*. Therefore, liquids and gases, collectively, are called fluids. A fluid either has no rigidity or its rigidity is very low.
In our daily life, we often experience the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest and in motion. Viscosity and surface tension play an important role in nature. We will try to understand such properties in this chapter.

## 2.2 Fluid:
Any substance that can flow is a fluid. A fluid is a substance that deforms continually under the action of an external force. Fluid is a phase of matter that includes liquids, gases and plasmas.

> **? Do you know?**

> Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter. It consists of a gas of ions, free electrons and neutral atoms.

We shall discuss mechanical properties of only liquids and gases in this Chapter. The shear modulus of a fluid is zero. In simpler words, fluids are substances which cannot resist any shear force applied to them. Air, water, flour dough, toothpaste, etc., are some common examples of fluids. Molten lava is also a fluid.

A fluid flows under the action of a force or a pressure gradient. Behaviour of a fluid in motion is normally complicated. We can understand fluids by making some simple assumptions. We introduce the concept of an ideal fluid to understand its behaviour. An ideal fluid has the following properties:
1.  It is incompressible: its density is constant.
2.  Its flow is irrotational: its flow is smooth, there are no turbulences in the flow.
3.  It is nonviscous: there is no internal friction in the flow, i.e., the fluid has no viscosity. (viscosity is discussed in section 2.6.1)
4.  Its flow is steady: its velocity at each point is constant in time.

It is important to understand the difference between a solid and a fluid. Solids can be subjected to shear stress (tangential stress) as shown in Fig. 2.1 and normal stress, as shown in Fig.2.2.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.1: Shear stress.**
A diagram shows a rectangle labeled ABCD. A tangential force F is applied to the top side DC. This causes the shape to deform into a parallelogram labeled AB C'D'. The top side has moved a distance Δl, so the top corners are now D' and C'. An angle θ is shown between the original vertical side AD and the new slanted side AD'.

**Fig. 2.2: Normal stress.**

Solids oppose the shear stress either by developing a restoring force, which means that the deformations are reversible, or they require a certain initial stress before they deform and start flowing. (We have studied this behavior of solids (elastic behaviour) in XIth Std).
Ideal fluids, on the other hand, can only be subjected to normal, compressive stress (called pressure). Most fluids offer a very

weak resistance to deformation. Real fluids display viscosity and so are capable of being subjected to low levels of shear stress.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.3: Forces acting on a small surface dA within a fluid at rest.**
A small rectangular surface of area dA is shown. Two equal and opposite normal forces, labeled dF, are acting on the two sides of this surface. One force points to the right, and the other to the left.
***
`dF <----[dA]----> dF`
**Fig. 2.3: Forces acting on a small surface dA within a fluid at rest.**

The Fig. 2.3 shows a small surface of area dA at rest within a fluid. The surface does not accelerate, so the surrounding fluid exerts equal normal forces dF on both sides of it.

**Properties of Fluids:**
1.  They do not oppose deformation, they get permanently deformed.
2.  They have ability to flow.
3.  They have ability to take the shape of the container.
A fluid exhibits these properties because it cannot oppose a shear stress when in static equilibrium.

> **Remember this**
>
> The term *fluid* includes both the liquid and gas phases. It is commonly used, as a synonym for *liquid* only, without any reference to gas. For example, 'brake fluid' is hydraulic oil and will not perform its required function if there is gas in it! This colloquial use of the term is also common in the fields of medicine and nutrition, e.g., “take plenty of fluids".

### 2.2.1 Fluids at Rest:
The branch of physics which deals with the properties of fluids at rest is called **hydrostatics**. In the next few sections we will consider some of the properties of fluids at rest.

## 2.3 Pressure:
A fluid at rest exerts a force on the surface of contact. The surface may be a wall or the bottom of an open container of the fluid. The normal force (F) exerted by a fluid at rest per unit surface area (A) of contact is called the pressure (p) of the fluid.
`p = F/A` --- (2.1)

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.4: Fluid exerts force on vertical surface.**
A vertical rectangular surface of area A is shown. Two equal and opposite normal forces, labeled F, are acting on the two sides of this surface.

Thus, an object having small weight can exert high pressure if its weight acts on a small surface area. For example, a force of 10 N acting on 1 cm² results in a pressure of 10⁵ N m⁻². On the other hand, the same force of 10 N while acting on an area of 1 m², exerts a pressure of only 10 N m⁻².

> **Remember this**

> 1 N weight is about 100 g mass, if g = 10 m s⁻².
>
> The SI unit of pressure is N/m². Also, 1 N/m² = 1 Pascal (Pa). The dimension of pressure is [L⁻¹M¹T⁻²]. Pressure is a *scalar* quantity. Other common units of measuring pressure of a gas are *bar* and *torr*. One torr is one mm of mercury column.
> 1 bar = 10⁵ Nm⁻²
> 1 hectapascal (hPa) = 100 Pa

> The concept of pressure is useful in dealing with fluids, i.e., liquids and gases. As fluids do not have definite shape and volume, it is convenient to use the quantities pressure and density rather than force and mass when studying hydrostatics and hydrodynamics.

### 2.3.1 Pressure Due to a Liquid Column:

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.6: Pressure due to a liquid column.**
A cylindrical container is shown filled with water. Inside the water, an imaginary cylinder of height 'h' and cross-sectional area 'A' is drawn. The top surface of the imaginary cylinder is at the water surface, which is exposed to air.

[Imaginary cylinder with height h, area A]
**Fig. 2.6: Pressure due to a liquid column.**

A vessel is filled with a liquid. Let us calculate the pressure exerted by an imaginary cylinder of cross sectional area A inside the container. Let the density of the fluid be ρ, and the height of the imaginary cylinder be h as shown in the Fig. 2.6. The liquid column exerts a force F = mg, which is its weight, on the bottom of the cylinder. This force acts in the downward direction. Therefore, the pressure p exerted by the liquid column on the bottom of cylinder is,
`p = F/A`
`∴ p = mg/A`
Now, m = (volume of cylinder) x (density of liquid)
`= (Ah) × ρ = Ahρ`
`∴ p = (Ahρ)g / A`
`p = hρg` --- (2.2)
Thus, the pressure p due to a liquid of density ρ at rest, and at a depth h below the free surface is hρg.
Note that the pressure dose not depend on the area of the imaginary cylinder used to derive the expression.

> **Remember this**
>
> 1. As p = hρg, the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest is independent of the shape and size of the container.
> 2. p = hρg is true for liquids as well as for gases.

**Example 2.1:** Two different liquids of density ρ₁ and ρ₂ exert the same pressure at a certain point. What will be the ratio of the heights of the respective liquid columns?
**Solution:** Let h₁ be the height of the liquid of density ρ₁. Then the pressure exerted by the liquid of density ρ₁ is p₁ = h₁ρ₁g. Similarly, let h₂ be the height of the liquid of density ρ₂. Then the pressure exerted by the liquid of density ρ₂ is p₂ = h₂ρ₂g.
Both liquids exert the same pressure, therefore we write,
`p₁ = p₂`
`∴ h₁ρ₁g = h₂ρ₂g` or, `h₁/h₂ = ρ₂/ρ₁`
**Alternate method:**
For a given value of p = hρg = constant, as g is constant. So the height is inversely proportional to the density of the fluid ρ. In this case, since pressure is constant, height is inversely proportional to density of the liquid.

**Example 2.2:** A swimmer is swimming in a swimming pool at 6 m below the surface of the water. Calculate the pressure on the swimmer due to water above. (Density of water = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.8 m/s²)
**Solution:** Given,
h = 6 m, ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.8 m/s²
p = hρg = 6 × 1000 × 9.8 = 5.88 × 10⁴ N/m²
(Which is nearly 0.6 times the atmospheric pressure!)

### 2.3.2 Atmospheric Pressure:
Earth's atmosphere is made up of a fluid, namely, air. It exerts a downward force due to its weight. The pressure due to this force is called atmospheric pressure. Thus, at any point, the atmospheric pressure is the weight of a column of air per unit cross section starting

---
*Page 28*
---

from that point and extending to the top of the atmosphere. Clearly, the atmospheric pressure is highest at the surface of the Earth, i.e., at the sea level, and decreases as we go above the surface as the height of the column of air above decreases. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is called **normal atmospheric pressure**. The density of air in the atmosphere decreases with increase in height and becomes negligible beyond a height of about 8 km so that the height of air column producing atmospheric pressure at sea level can be taken to be 8 km.
The region where gas pressure is less than the atmospheric pressure is called **vacuum**. Perfect or absolute vacuum is when no matter, i.e., no atoms or molecules are present. Usually, vacuum refers to conditions when the gas pressure is considerably smaller than the atmospheric pressure.

### 2.3.3 Absolute Pressure and Gauge Pressure:
Consider a tank filled with water as shown in Fig. 2.7. Assume an imaginary cylinder of horizontal base area A and height x₁ - x₂ = h. x₁ and x₂ being the heights measured from a reference point, height increasing upwards: x₁ > x₂. The vertical forces acting on the cylinder are:
1. Force F₁ acts downwards at the top surface of the cylinder, and is due to the weight of the water column above the cylinder.
2. Force F₂ acts upwards at the bottom surface of the cylinder, and is due to the water below the cylinder.
3. The gravitational force on the water enclosed in the cylinder is mg, where m is the mass of the water in the cylinder. As the water is in static equilibrium, the forces on the cylinder are balanced. The balance of these forces in magnitude is written as,
`F₂ = F₁ + mg` --- (2.3)
p₁ and p₂ are the pressures at the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder respectively due to the fluid. Using Eq. (2.1) we can write
`F₁ = p₁A`, and `F₂ = p₂A` --- (2.4)
Also, the mass m of the water in the cylinder can be written as,
`m = density × volume = ρV`
`∴ m = ρA(x₁-x₂)` --- (2.5)

Substituting Eq. (2.4) and Eq. (2.5) in Eq. (2.3) we get,
`p₂A = p₁A + ρAg(x₁-x₂)`
`p₂ = p₁ + ρg(x₁-x₂)` --- (2.6)
This equation can be used to find the pressure inside a liquid (as a function of depth below the liquid surface) and also the atmospheric pressure (as a function of altitude or height above the sea level).

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.7: Pressure due to an imaginary cylinder of fluid.**
A container with water is shown. An imaginary cylinder is drawn inside the water. The top surface of the cylinder is at a height x₁ and has pressure p₁ and a downward force F₁. The bottom surface is at height x₂ and has pressure p₂ and an upward force F₂. The weight of the water inside the cylinder, mg, acts downwards. The top of the water is exposed to air.
***

**Fig. 2.7: Pressure due to an imaginary cylinder of fluid.**

To find the pressure p at a depth h below the liquid surface, let the top of an imaginary cylinder be at the surface of the liquid. Let this level be x₁. Let x₂ be some point at depth h below the surface as shown in Fig. 2.8. Let p₀ be the atmospheric pressure at the surface, i.e., at x₁. Then, substituting x₁ = 0, p₁ = p₀, x₂ = -h, and p₂ = p in Eq. (2.6) we get,
`p = p₀ + hρg` --- (2.7)
The above equation gives the total pressure, or the **absolute pressure** p, at a depth h below the surface of the liquid. The total pressure p, at the depth h is the sum of:
1. p₀, the pressure due to the atmosphere, which acts on the surface of the liquid, and
2. hρg, the pressure due to the liquid at depth h.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.8. Pressure at a depth h below the surface of a liquid.**
A container with water is shown. The water surface is exposed to air and is at level x₁. A point is shown at a depth h below the surface, at level x₂.

In general, the difference between the absolute pressure and the atmospheric pressure is called the **gauge pressure**. Using Eq. (2.7), gauge pressure at depth h below the liquid surface can be written as,
`p - p₀ = hρg` --- (2.8)
Eq. (2.8) is also applicable to levels above the liquid surface. It gives the pressure at a given height above a liquid surface, in terms of the atmospheric pressure p₀ (assuming that the atmospheric density is uniform up to that height).
To find the atmospheric pressure at a distance d above the liquid surface as shown in Fig. 2.9, we substitute x₁ = d, p₁ = p, x₂ = 0, p₂ = p₀ and ρ = ρ_air in Eq. (2.6) we get,
`p = p₀ - dρ_air g` --- (2.9)

### 2.3.4 Hydrostatic Paradox:
Consider the inter connected vessels as shown in Fig. 2.10 (a). When a liquid is poured in any one of the vessels, it is noticed that the level of liquids in all the vessels is the same. This observation is somewhat puzzling. It was called 'hydrostatics paradox' before the principle of hydrostatics were completely understood.
One can feel that the pressure of the base of the vessel C would be more than that at the base of the vessel B and the liquid from vessel C would rise into the vessel B. However, it is never observed. Equation 2.2 tells that the pressure at a point depends only on the height of the liquid column above it. It does not depend on the shape of the vessel. In this case, height of the liquid column is the same for all the vessels. Therefore, the pressure of liquid column in each vessel is the same and the system is in equilibrium. That means the liquid in vessel C does not rise in to vessel B.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.10: Hydrostatic paradox.**
(a) A set of interconnected vessels of different shapes (labeled A, B, C, D) is shown. When a liquid is poured in, it settles to the same level in all vessels.
(b) A diagram of a vessel with sloping sides (labeled ABA). Arrows are drawn perpendicular to the walls, indicating the forces exerted by the walls on the liquid. These forces are perpendicular to the walls at each point.

**(a)** Interconnected vessels A, B, C, D with liquid at the same level.
**(b)** Vessel with sloping sides. Forces exerted by walls on the liquid are shown by arrows perpendicular to the walls.
**Fig. 2.10: Hydrostatic paradox.**

Consider Fig. 2.10 (b). The arrows indicate the forces exerted against the liquid by the walls of the vessel. These forces are perpendicular to walls of the vessel at each point. These forces can be resolved into vertical and horizontal components. The vertical components act in the upward direction. Weight of the liquid in section B is not balanced and contributes the pressure at the base. Thus, it is no longer a paradox!

### 2.3.5 Pascal's Law:
**Pascal's law states that the pressure applied at any point of an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted equally and undiminished to every point of the fluid and also on the walls of the container, provided the effect of gravity is neglected.**

**Experimental proof of Pascal's law.**
Consider a vessel with four arms A, B, C, and D fitted with frictionless, water tight pistons and filled with incompressible fluid as shown in the figure given. Let the area of cross sections of A, B, C, and D be a, 2a, 3a, and a/2 respectively. If a force F is applied on the piston A, the pressure exerted on the liquid is p = F/a. It is observed that the other three pistons B, C, and D move outward. In order to keep these three pistons B, C,

---
*Page 30*
---

and D in their original positions, forces 2F, 3F, and F/2 respectively are required to be applied on the pistons. Therefore, pressure on the pistons B, C, and D is:

***
**Image Description: Experimental setup for Pascal's law.**
A vessel with four cylindrical arms labeled A, B, C, and D is filled with a fluid. Each arm has a piston.
- Arm A (top): Area 'a', downward force F is applied.
- Arm B (right): Area '2a', outward force is 2F.
- Arm C (bottom): Area '3a', outward force is 3F.
- Arm D (left): Area 'a/2', outward force is F/2.
The diagram shows that the pressure (Force/Area) is the same on all pistons.
***
on B, `p_B = 2F / 2a = F/a`
on C, `p_C = 3F / 3a = F/a`
on D, `p_D = (F/2) / (a/2) = F/a`
i.e. `p_B = p_C = p_D = p`, this indicates that the pressure applied on piston A is transmitted equally and undiminished to all parts of the fluid and the walls of the vessel.

**Applications of Pascal's Law:**
**i) Hydraulic lift:** Hydraulic lift is used to lift a heavy object using a small force. The working of this machine is based on Pascal's law.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.11 Hydraulic Lift.**
A U-shaped container is filled with a fluid. It has two pistons, S₁ and S₂.
- Piston S₁ has a smaller cross-sectional area A₁. A downward force F₁ is applied to it, creating pressure p₁.
- Piston S₂ has a larger cross-sectional area A₂. The pressure p₂ from the fluid exerts an upward force F₂ on it.
The diagram shows that p₁ = p₂.
***
**Fig. 2.11 Hydraulic Lift.**

As shown in Fig. 2.11, a tank containing a fluid is fitted with two pistons S₁ and S₂. S₁ has a smaller area of cross section, A₁ while S₂ has a much larger area of cross section, A₂ (A₂ >> A₁). If we apply a force F₁ on the smaller piston S₁ in the downward direction it will generate pressure p = (F₁/A₁) which will be transmitted undiminished to the bigger piston S₂. A force F₂ = pA₂ will be exerted upwards on it.
`F₂ = F₁ (A₂/A₁)` --- (2.10)
Thus, F₂ is much larger than F₁. A heavy load can be placed on S₂ and can be lifted up or moved down by applying a small force on S₁. This is the principle of a hydraulic lift.

> **Observe and discuss**
>
> Blow air in to a flat balloon using a cycle pump. Discuss how Pascal's principle is applicable here.

**ii) Hydraulic brakes:** Hydraulic brakes are used to slow down or stop vehicles in motion. It is based on the same principle as that of a hydraulic lift.
Figure 2.12 shows schematic diagram of a hydraulic brake system. By pressing the brake pedal, the piston of the master cylinder is pushed in forward direction. As a result, the piston in the slave cylinder which has a much larger area of cross section as compared to that of the master cylinder, also moves in forward direction so as to maintain the volume of the oil constant. The slave piston pushes the friction pads against the rotating disc, which is connected to the wheel. Thus, causing a moving vehicle to slow down or stop.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.12 Hydraulic brake system (schematic).**
A schematic diagram of a hydraulic brake system. A brake pedal is connected to a master cylinder with a piston of area A₁. When the pedal is pressed, it applies a force F₁. This master cylinder is connected by hydraulic tubes filled with brake fluid to four slave cylinders, one for each wheel. The slave cylinders have pistons of a larger area A₂. The force from the master cylinder is transmitted through the fluid to the slave cylinders, which then push brake pads against the wheels to stop the car.
***
**Fig. 2.12 Hydraulic brake system (schematic).**

The master cylinder has a smaller area of cross section A₁ compared to the area A₂ of the slave cylinder. By applying a small force F₁

---
*Page 31*
---

to the master cylinder, we generate pressure p = (F₁/A₁). This pressure is transmitted undiminished throughout the system. The force F₂ on slave cylinder is then,
`F₂ = pA₂ = (F₁/A₁)A₂ = F₁(A₂/A₁)`
This is similar to the principle used in hydraulic lift. Since area A₂ is greater than A₁, F₂ is also greater than F₁. Thus, a small force applied on the brake pedal gets converted into large force and slows down or stops a moving vehicle.

**Example 2.3:** A hydraulic brake system of a car of mass 1000 kg having speed of 50 km/h, has a cylindrical piston of radius of 0.5 cm. The slave cylinder has a radius of 2.5 cm. If a constant force of 100 N is applied on the brake what distance the car will travel before coming to stop?
**Solution:** Given,
F₁ = 100 N, A₁ = π (0.5 × 10⁻²)² m²,
A₂ = π (2.5 × 10⁻²)² m², F₂ = ?
By Pascal's Principle,
`F₂/A₂ = F₁/A₁`
`F₂ = 100 × (π(2.5×10⁻²)²) / (π(0.5×10⁻²)²) = 2500 N`
Acceleration of the car =
`a = F₂ / m = 2500/1000 = 2.5 m/s²`. Using Newton's equation of motion,
`v² = u² - 2as` where final velocity v = 0, u = 50 km/h
`s = u² / (2a) = ((50×1000)/3600)² / (2×2.5) = 38.58 m`

### 2.3.6 Measurement of Pressure:
Instruments used to measure pressure are called pressure meters or pressure gauges or vacuum gauges. Below we will describe two instruments which are commonly used to measure pressure.

> **Caution:**
> Use of mercury is not advised in a laboratory because mercury vapours are hazardous for life and for environment.

**i) Mercury Barometer:** An instrument that measures atmospheric pressure is called a **barometer**. One of the first barometers was invented by the Italian scientist Torricelli. The barometer is in the form of a glass tube completely filled with mercury and placed upside down in a small dish containing mercury. Its schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2.13.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.13: Mercury barometer.**
A vertical glass tube, closed at the top and open at the bottom, is inverted in a dish of mercury. The mercury column in the tube stands at a height 'h' above the mercury level in the dish. The space above the mercury column in the tube is a vacuum, called Torricelli's vacuum. Point A is at the top of the mercury column inside the tube. Point B is inside the tube at the same level as the mercury surface in the dish. Point C is on the mercury surface in the dish, open to the atmosphere.
***
**Fig. 2.13: Mercury barometer.**

1.  A glass tube of about 1 meter length and a diameter of about 1 cm is filled with mercury up to its brim. It is then quickly inverted into a small dish containing mercury. The level of mercury in the glass tube lowers as some mercury spills in the dish. A gap is created between the surface of mercury in the glass tube and the closed end of the glass tube. The gap does not contain any air and it is called **Torricelli's vacuum**. It does contain some mercury vapors.
2.  Thus, the pressure at the upper end of the mercury column inside the tube is zero, i.e. pressure at point such as A is P_A = zero.
3.  Let us consider a point C on the mercury surface in the dish and another point B inside the tube at the same horizontal level as that of the point C.
4.  The pressure at C is equal to the atmospheric pressure p₀ because it is open to atmosphere. As points B and C are at the same horizontal level, the pressure at B is also equal to the atmospheric pressure p₀, i.e. P_B = p₀.
5.  Suppose the point B is at a depth h below the point A and ρ is the density of mercury then,
`P_B = P_A + hρg` --- (2.11)

---
*Page 32*
---

`P_A = 0` (there is vacuum above point A) and `P_B = p₀`, therefore, `p₀ = hρg`, where `h` is the length of mercury column in the mercury barometer.

> **Remember this**
>
> The atmospheric pressure is generally expressed as the length of mercury column in a mercury barometer.
> `P_atm = 76 cm of Hg = 760 mm of Hg = 760 Torr.`

> **Can you tell?**
>
> What will be the normal atmospheric pressure in bar and also in torr?

**ii) Open tube manometer:** A manometer consists of a U – shaped tube partly filled with a low density liquid such as water or kerosene. This helps in having a larger level difference between the level of liquid in the two arms of the manometer. Figure 2.14 shows an open tube manometer. One arm of the manometer is open to the atmosphere and the other is connected to the container D of which the pressure p is to be measured.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.14 Open tube manometer.**
A U-shaped tube contains a liquid. The left arm is connected to a container D containing a gas whose pressure p is to be measured. The right arm is open to the atmosphere (pressure p₀). The liquid level in the left arm (at point C) is lower than the liquid level in the right arm (at point A). The difference in height between the two levels is 'h'. Point B is in the right arm at the same horizontal level as point C.
***
**Fig. 2.14 Open tube manometer.**

The pressure at point A is atmospheric pressure p₀ because this arm is open to atmosphere. To find the pressure at point C, which is exposed to the pressure of the gas in the container, we consider a point B in the open arm of the manometer at the same level as point C. The pressure at the points B and C is the same, i.e.,
`p_C = p_B` --- (2.12)
The pressure at point B is,
`p_B = p₀ + hρg` --- (2.13)
where, ρ is the density of the liquid in the manometer, h is the height of the liquid column above point B, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. According to Pascal's principle, pressure at C is the same as at D, i.e., inside the chamber. Therefore, the pressure p in the container is,
`p = p_C`
Using Eq. (2.12) and Eq. (2.13) we can write,
`p = p₀ + hρg` --- (2.14)
As the manometer measures the gauge pressure of the gas in the container D, we can write the gauge pressure in the container D as
`p - p₀ = hρg`

## 2.4 Surface Tension:
A liquid at rest shows a very interesting property called **surface tension**. We have seen that water spider walks on the surface of steady water, greased needle floats on the steady surface of water, rain drops and soap bubbles always take spherical shape, etc. All these phenomena arise due to surface tension. Surface tension is one of the important properties of liquids.

### 2.4.1 Molecular Theory of Surface Tension:
All the above observations can be explained on the basis of different types of forces coming into play in all these situations. We will try to understand the effect of these forces and their relation to the surface tension in liquids.

---
*Page 33*
---

To understand surface tension, we need to know some terms in molecular theory that explain the behaviour of liquids at their surface.
**a) Intermolecular force:** Matter is made up of molecules. Any two molecules attract each other. This force between molecules is called intermolecular force. There are two types of intermolecular forces - i) Cohesive force and ii) Adhesive force.
**i) Cohesive force:** The force of attraction between the molecules of the same substance is called cohesive force or force of cohesion. The force of attraction between two air molecules or that between two water molecules is a cohesive force. Cohesive force is strongest in solids and weakest in gases. This is the reason why solids have a definite shape and gases do not. Small droplets of liquid coalesce into one and form a drop due to this force.
**ii) Adhesive force:** The force of attraction between the molecules of different substances is called adhesive force or force of adhesion. The force of attraction between glass and water molecule is a force of adhesion.
**b) Range of molecular force:** The maximum distance from a molecule up to which the molecular force is effective is called the range of molecular force. Intermolecular forces are effective up to a distance of the order of few nanometer (10⁻⁹ m) in solids and liquids. Therefore, they are short range forces.
**c) Sphere of influence:** An imaginary sphere with a molecule at its center and radius equal to the molecular range is called the sphere of influence of the molecule. The spheres around molecules A, B or C are shown in Fig. 2.15 (a) and (b). The intermolecular force is effective only within the sphere of influence.
**d) Surface film:** The surface layer of a liquid with thickness equal to the range of intermolecular force is called the surface film. This is the layer shown between XY and X'Y' in Fig. 2.15 (b).

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.15: (a) sphere of influence and (b) surface film.**
(a) Shows a single molecule with its sphere of influence drawn as a dashed circle around it.
(b) Shows a liquid with a free surface labeled XY. A layer just below the surface, labeled X'Y', is parallel to XY. The region between XY and X'Y' is the surface film. Three molecules are shown:
- Molecule A is deep inside the liquid, with its sphere of influence entirely within the liquid.
- Molecule B is in the surface film, with most of its sphere of influence in the liquid and a small part in the air above.
- Molecule C is on the free surface XY, with half of its sphere of influence in the liquid and half in the air.
***
**Fig. 2.15: (a) sphere of influence and (b) surface film.**

**(e) Free surface of a liquid:** It is the surface of a fluid which does not experience any shear stress. For example, the interface between liquid water and the air above. In Fig. 2.15 (b), XY is the free surface of the liquid.

> **Remember this**
>
> While studying pressure, we considered both liquids and gases. But as gases do not have a free surface, they do not exhibit surface tension.

**(f) Surface tension on the basis of molecular theory:** As shown in Fig. 2.15 (b), XY is the free surface of liquid and X'Y' is the inner layer parallel to XY at distance equal to the range of molecular force. Hence, the section XX'-Y'Y near the surface of the liquid acts as the surface film. Consider three molecules A, B, and C such that molecule A is deep inside the liquid, molecule B within surface film and molecule C on the surface of the liquid.
As molecule A is deep inside the liquid, its sphere of influence is also completely inside the liquid. As a result, molecule A is acted upon by equal cohesive forces in all directions. Thus, the net cohesive force acting on molecule A is zero.
Molecule B lies within the surface layer and below the free surface of the liquid. A larger part of its sphere of influence is inside the liquid and a smaller part is in air. Due to this, a strong downward cohesive force acts on the liquid molecule. The adhesive force acting on molecule B due to air molecules above it and within its sphere of influence is weak. It points upwards. As a result, the molecule B gets attracted inside the liquid.

---
*Page 34*
---

The same holds for molecule C which lies exactly on the free surface of the liquid. Half of the sphere of influence is in air and half in the liquid. The number of air molecules within the sphere of influence of the molecule C, above the free surface of the liquid is much less than the number of liquid molecules within the sphere of influence that lies within the liquid. This is because, the density of air is less than that of a liquid. The adhesive force trying to pull the molecule above the liquid surface is much weaker than the cohesive force that tries to pull the molecule inside the liquid surface. As a result, the molecule C also gets attracted inside the liquid.
Thus, all molecules in the surface film are acted upon by an unbalanced net cohesive force directed into the liquid. Therefore, the molecules in the surface film are pulled inside the liquid. This minimizes the total number of molecules in the surface film. As a result, the surface film remains under tension. The surface film of a liquid behaves like a stretched elastic membrane. This tension is known as **surface tension**. The force due to surface tension acts tangential to the free surface of a liquid.

### 2.4.2 Surface Tension and Surface Energy:
**a) Surface Tension:** As seen previously, the free surface of a liquid in a container acts as a stretched membrane and all molecules on the surface film experience a stretching force. Imagine a line PQ of length L drawn tangential to the free surface of the liquid, as shown in Fig. 2.16.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.16: Force of surface tension.**
A top-down view of a liquid surface. An imaginary line PQ is drawn on the surface. Forces labeled F are shown acting perpendicular to the line PQ on both sides, pulling the surface apart.
***
**Fig. 2.16: Force of surface tension.**

All the molecules on this line experience equal and opposite forces tangential to surface as if they are tearing the surface apart due to the cohesive forces of molecules lying on either side. This force per unit length is the surface tension. Surface tension T is defined as, the tangential force acting per unit length on both sides of an imaginary line drawn on the free surface of liquid.
`T = F/L` --- (2.15)
SI unit of surface tension is N/m. Its dimensions are, [L⁰M¹T⁻²].

> **Use your brain power**
>
> Prove that, equivalent S.I. unit of surface tension is J/m².

**Example 2.4:** A beaker of radius 10 cm is filled with water. Calculate the force of surface tension on any diametrical line on its surface. Surface tension of water is 0.075 N/m.
**Solution:** Given,
L = 2 × 10 = 20 cm = 0.2 m
T = 0.075 N/m
We have,
`T = F/L`
`... F = TL = 0.075 × 0.2 = 0.015`
`= 1.5 × 10⁻² N`

**Table 2.1 - Surface tension of some liquids at 20°C.**
| Sr. No. | Liquid | S.T. (N/m) | S.T. (dyne/cm) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Water | 0.0727 | 72.7 |
| 2 | Mercury | 0.4355 | 435.5 |
| 3 | Soap solution | 0.025 | 25 |
| 4 | Glycerin | 0.0632 | 63.2 |

**b) Surface Energy:** We have seen that a molecule inside the volume of a liquid (like molecule A in Fig 2.15) experiences no net cohesive force and the molecules B and C experience net inward cohesive force. Thus, work has to be done to bring any molecule from inside the liquid into the surface film. Clearly, the surface molecules possess extra potential energy as compared to the molecules inside the liquid. The extra energy of the molecules

---
*Page 35*
---

in the surface layer is called the **surface energy** of the liquid. As any system always tries to attain a state of minimum potential energy, the liquid tries to reduce the area of its surface film. Energy has to be spent in order to increase the surface area of a liquid.

> **Remember this**
>
> 1) Molecules on the liquid surface experience net inward pull. In spite of this if they remain at the surface, they possess higher potential energy. As a universal property, any system tries to minimize its potential energy. Hence liquid surface tries to minimize its surface area.
> 2) When a number of droplets coalesce and form a drop, there is reduction in the total surface area. In this case, energy is released to the surrounding.

**c) Relation between the surface energy and surface tension:** Consider a C shaped frame of wire P'PSS'. It is fitted with a movable arm QR as shown in Fig. 2.17. This frame is dipped in a soap solution and then taken out. A film of soap solution will be formed within the boundaries PQRS of the frame.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.17: Surface energy of a liquid**
A rectangular wire frame PQRS is shown. The side QR is a movable arm. A soap film is formed within the frame. Due to surface tension, an inward force F acts on the arm QR. An external force F' is applied to pull the arm from QR to a new position Q'R' by a distance dx, increasing the surface area of the film. The length of the arm QR is L.
***
**Fig. 2.17: Surface energy of a liquid**

Each arm of the frame experiences an inward force due to the film. Under the action of this force, the movable arm QR moves towards side PS so as to decrease the area of the film. If the length of QR is L, then this inward force F acting on it is given by
`F = (T) × (2L)` --- (2.16)
Since the film has two surfaces, the upper surface and the lower surface, the total length over which surface tension acts on QR is 2L. Imagine an external force F' (equal and opposite to F) applied isothermally (gradually and at constant temperature), to the arm QR, so that it pulls the arm away and tries to increase the surface area of the film. The arm QR moves to Q'R' through a distance dx. Therefore, the work done against F, the force due to surface tension, is given by
`dw = F'dx`
Using Eq. (2.16),
`dw = T (2Ldx)`
But, 2Ldx = dA, increase in area of the two surfaces of the film. Therefore, `dw = T(dA)`.
This work done in stretching the film is stored in the area dA of the film as its potential energy. This energy is called **surface energy**.
`∴ Surface energy = T (dA)` --- (2.17)
Thus, surface tension is also equal to the surface energy per unit area.

**Example 2.5:** Calculate the work done in blowing a soap bubble to a radius of 1 cm. The surface tension of soap solution is 2.5 x 10⁻² N/m.
**Solution:** Given
T = 2.5 x 10⁻² N/m
Initial radius of bubble = 0 cm
Final radius of bubble, r = 1 cm = 0.01 m
Initial surface area of soap bubble = 0
(A soap bubble has two surfaces, outer surface and inner surface).
Final surface area of soap bubble is,
`A = 2 × (4πr²) = 8πr²`
`∴ change in area = dA = A − 0 = 8πr²`
`= 8π(0.01)² = 0.002514 m²`
`∴ work done = T × dA`
`= 2.5 x 10⁻² × 0.002514`
`= 6.284 × 10⁻⁵ J`

> Take a ring of about 5 cm in diameter. Tie a thin thread along the diameter of the ring. Keep the thread slightly loose. Dip the ring in a soap solution and take it out. A soap film is formed on either side of thread. Break the film on any one side of the thread. Discuss the result.

### 2.4.3 Angle of Contact:
When a liquid surface comes in contact with a solid surface, it forms a meniscus, which can be either convex (mercury-glass) or concave (water glass), as shown in Fig. 2.18. The **angle of contact**, θ, between a liquid and a solid surface is defined as the angle between the tangents drawn to the free surface of the liquid and surface of the solid at the point of contact, measured within the liquid.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.18 (a) and (b).**
(a) Concave meniscus: A glass tube is dipped in a liquid that wets the glass. The liquid level inside the tube is higher, and the surface is curved downwards (concave). The angle of contact is shown as acute.
(b) Convex meniscus: A glass tube is dipped in a liquid that does not wet the glass. The liquid level inside the tube is lower, and the surface is curved upwards (convex). The angle of contact is shown as obtuse.
***
**Fig. 2.18 (a): Concave meniscus due to liquids which partially wet a solid surface.**
**Fig. 2.18 (b): Convex meniscus due to liquids which do not wet a solid surface.**

When the angle of contact is acute, the liquid forms a concave meniscus Fig. 2.18(a) at the point of contact. When the angle of contact is obtuse, it forms a convex meniscus Fig. 2.18(b). For example, water-glass interface forms a concave meniscus and mercury-glass interface forms a convex meniscus.
This difference between the shapes of menisci is due to the net effect of the cohesive forces between liquid molecules and adhesive forces between liquid and solid molecules as discussed below.

> **? Do you know?**
>
> - when we observe the level of water in a capillary, we note down the level of the tangent to the meniscus inside the water.
> - When we observe the level of mercury in a capillary we note down the level of the tangent to the meniscus above the mercury column.

**a) Shape of meniscus:**
**i) Concave meniscus - acute angle of contact:**

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.19 (a): Acute angle of contact.**
A diagram shows the forces acting on a liquid molecule 'A' at the point of contact with a solid wall.
- A sphere of influence is drawn around molecule A.
- `AP` is the horizontal adhesive force from the solid wall.
- `AC` is the cohesive force from other liquid molecules, directed into the liquid at approximately 45 degrees from the vertical.
- `AR` is the resultant force of `AP` and `AC`, directed into the solid.
- `AT` is the tangent to the liquid surface at point A. For equilibrium, `AT` must be perpendicular to `AR`. This results in a concave meniscus.
The angle of contact θ is acute.
***
**Fig. 2.19 (a): Acute angle of contact.**

Figure 2.19 (a) shows the acute angle of contact between a liquid surface (e.g., kerosene in a glass bottle). Consider a molecule such as A on the surface of the liquid near the wall of the container. The molecule experiences both cohesive as well as adhesive forces. In this case, since the wall is vertical, the net adhesive force (`AP`) acting on the molecule A is horizontal, Net cohesive force (`AC`) acting on molecule is directed at nearly 45° to either of the surfaces. Magnitude of adhesive force is so large that the net force (`AR`) is directed inside the solid.
For equilibrium or stability of a liquid surface, the net force (`AR`) acting on the molecule A must be normal to the liquid surface at all points. For the resultant force `AR` to be normal to the tangent, the liquid near the wall should pile up against the solid boundary so that the tangent AT to the liquid surface is perpendicular to `AR`. Thus, this makes the meniscus concave. Obviously, such liquid wets that solid surface.

**ii) Convex meniscus - obtuse angle of contact:**
Figure 2.19 (b) shows the obtuse angle of contact between a liquid and a solid (e.g., mercury in a glass bottle). Consider a molecule such as A on the surface of the liquid

---
*Page 37*
---

near the wall of the container. The molecule experiences both cohesive as well as adhesive forces. In this case also, the net adhesive force (`AP`) acting on the molecule A is horizontal since the wall is vertical. Magnitude of cohesive force is so large that the net force (`AR`) is directed inside the liquid.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.19 (b): Obtuse angle of contact.**
A diagram shows the forces acting on a liquid molecule 'A' at the point of contact with a solid wall.
- A sphere of influence is drawn around molecule A.
- `AP` is the horizontal adhesive force from the solid wall.
- `AC` is the cohesive force from other liquid molecules, which is strong and directed into the liquid.
- `AR` is the resultant force of `AP` and `AC`, directed into the liquid.
- `AT` is the tangent to the liquid surface at point A. For equilibrium, `AT` must be perpendicular to `AR`. This results in a convex meniscus.
The angle of contact θ is obtuse.
***
**Fig. 2.19 (b): Obtuse angle of contact.**

For equilibrium or stability of a liquid surface, the net force (`AR`) acting on all molecules similar to molecule A must be normal to the liquid surface at all points. The liquid near the wall should, therefore, creep inside against the solid boundary. This makes the meniscus convex so that its tangent AT is normal to `AR`. Obviously, such liquid does not wet that solid surface.

**iii) Zero angle of contact :**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.19 (c): Angle of contact equal to zero.**
A diagram shows the forces acting on a liquid molecule 'A' for a liquid that completely wets the solid.
- The cohesive force `AC` is negligible.
- The adhesive force `AP` is the resultant force `AR`.
- The tangent `AT` is along the solid wall, inside the liquid.
- The angle of contact θ = 0.
***
**Fig. 2.19 (c): Angle of contact equal to zero.**

Figure 2.19 (c) shows the angle of contact between a liquid (e.g. highly pure water) which completely wets a solid (e.g. clean glass) surface. The angle of contact in this case is almost zero (i.e., θ → 0°). In this case, the liquid molecules near the contact region, are so less in number that the cohesive force is negligible, i.e., `AC ≈ 0` and the net adhesive force itself is the resultant force, i.e., `AP ≈ AR`. Therefore, the tangent AT is along the wall within the liquid and the angle of contact is zero.

**iv) Angle of contact 90° and conditions for convexity and concavity:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.19 (d): Acute angle equal to 90°.**
A diagram for a hypothetical liquid with a 90° angle of contact.
- Molecule A is at the contact point.
- The cohesive force `AC` is at 45° to the surface.
- The adhesive force `AP` is horizontal.
- The resultant force `AR` is vertical, along the solid surface.
The liquid surface is flat, and the tangent is horizontal.
***
**Fig. 2.19 (d): Acute angle equal to 90°.**

Consider a hypothetical liquid having angle of contact 90° with a given solid container, as shown in the Fig. 2.19 (d). In this case, the net cohesive force `AC` is exactly at 45° with either of the surfaces and the resultant force `AR` is exactly vertical (along the solid surface).
For this to occur, `AP = AC/√2` where, AC is the magnitude of the net cohesive force. From this we can write the conditions for acute and obtuse angles of contact:
For acute angle of contact, `AP > AC/√2`, and for obtuse angle of contact, `AP < AC/√2`.

> How does a water proofing agent work?

**b) Shape of liquid drops on a solid surface:**
When a small amount of a liquid is dropped on a plane solid surface, the liquid will either spread on the surface or will form droplets on the surface. Which phenomenon will occur depends on the surface tension of the liquid and the angle of contact between the liquid and the solid surface. The surface tension between the liquid and air as well as that between solid and air will also have to be taken in to account.
Let θ be the angle of contact for the given solid-liquid pair.
T₁ = Force due to surface tension at the liquid-solid interface,
T₂ = Force due to surface tension at the air-solid interface,

---
*Page 38*
---
T₃ = Force due to surface tension at the air-liquid interface.
As the force due to surface tension is tangential to the surfaces in contact, directions of T₁, T₂ and T₃ are as shown in the Fig. 2.20.
For equilibrium of the drop,
`T₂ = T₁ + T₃cosθ`
`cosθ = (T₂ - T₁) / T₃` --- (2.18)
From this equation we get the following cases:
1) If T₂ > T₁ and (T₂ - T₁) < T₃, cosθ is positive and the angle of contact θ is acute as shown in Fig. 2.20 (a).

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.20 (a): Acute angle of contact.**
A liquid drop on a solid surface with an acute angle of contact θ. The forces T₁ (liquid-solid), T₂ (air-solid), and T₃ (air-liquid) are shown acting at the point of contact. T₂ acts along the solid surface away from the drop. T₁ acts along the solid surface into the drop. T₃ acts along the tangent to the drop's surface.
***
**Fig. 2.20 (a): Acute angle of contact.**

2) If T₂ < T₁ and (T₂ - T₁) < T₃, cosθ is negative, and the angle of contact θ is obtuse as shown in Fig. 2.20(b).

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.20 (b): Obtuse angle of contact.**
A liquid drop on a solid surface with an obtuse angle of contact θ. The forces T₁, T₂, and T₃ are shown similarly to the previous figure.
***
**Fig. 2.20 (b): Obtuse angle of contact.**

3) If (T₂ - T₁) = T₃, cosθ = 1 and θ is nearly equal to zero.
4) If (T₂ - T₁) > T₃ or T₂ > (T₁ + T₃), cosθ > 1 which is impossible. The liquid spreads over the solid surface and drop will not be formed.

**c) Factors affecting the angle of contact:**
The value of the angle of contact depends on the following factors,
i) The nature of the liquid and the solid in contact.
ii) Impurity : Impurities present in the liquid change the angle of contact.
iii) Temperature of the liquid : Any increase in the temperature of a liquid decreases its angle of contact. For a given solid-liquid surface, the angle of contact is constant at a given temperature.

**Table 2.2 - Angle of contact for pair of liquid - solid in contact.**
| Sr. No. | Liquid - solid in contact | Angle of contact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pure water and clean glass | 0° |
| 2 | Chloroform with clean glass | 0° |
| 3 | Organic liquids with clean glass | 0° |
| 4 | Ether with clean glass | 16° |
| 5 | Kerosene with clean glass | 26° |
| 6 | Water with paraffin | 107° |
| 7 | Mercury with clean glass | 140° |

### 2.4.4 Effect of impurity and temperature on surface tension:
**a) Effect of impurities:**
i) When soluble substance such as common salt (i.e., sodium chloride) is dissolved in water, the surface tension of water increases.
ii) When a sparingly soluble substance such as phenol or a detergent is mixed with water, surface tension of water decreases. For example, a detergent powder is mixed with water to wash clothes. Due to this, the surface tension of water decreases and water makes good contact with the fabric and is able to remove tough stains.
iii) When insoluble impurity is added into water, surface tension of water decreases. When impurity gets added to any liquid, the cohesive force of that liquid decreases which affects the angle of contact and hence the shape of the meniscus. If mercury gathers dust then its surface tension is reduced. It does not form spherical droplets unless the dust is completely removed.

**b) Effect of temperature:** In most liquids, as temperature increases surface tension decreases. For example, it is suggested that new cotton fabric should be washed in cold water. In this case, water does not make good contact with the fabric due to its higher surface tension. The fabric does not lose its colour because of this.

---
*Page 39*
---

Hot water is used to remove tough stains on fabric because of its lower surface tension. In the case of molten copper or molten cadmium, the surface tension increases with increase in its temperature.
The surface tension of a liquid becomes zero at critical temperature.

### 2.4.5 Excess pressure across the free surface of a liquid:
Every molecule on a liquid surface experiences forces due to surface tension which are tangential to the liquid surface at rest. The direction of the resultant force of surface tension acting on a molecule on the liquid surface depends upon the shape of that liquid surface. This force also contributes in deciding the pressure at a point just below the surface of a liquid.
Figures 2.21 (a), (b) and (c) show surfaces of three liquids with different shapes and their menisci. Let `f_A` be the downward force due to the atmospheric pressure. All the three figures show two molecules A and B. The molecule A is just above, and the molecule B is just below it (inside the liquid). Level difference between A and B is almost zero, so that it does not contribute anything to the pressure difference. In all the three figures, the pressure at the point A is the atmospheric pressure p.

**a) Plane liquid surface:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.21 (a): Plane surface.**
A flat liquid surface is shown. A molecule B is just below the surface. The resultant force due to surface tension, `f_T`, on molecule B is zero. A downward force `f_A` due to atmospheric pressure acts on it.
***
**Fig. 2.21 (a): Plane surface.**
Figure 2.21 (a) shows planar free surface of the liquid. In this case, the resultant force due to surface tension, `f_T`, on the molecule at B is zero. The force `f_A` itself decides the pressure and the pressure at A and B is the same.

**b) Convex liquid surface:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.21 (b) : Convex surface.**
A convex liquid surface is shown. A molecule B is just below the surface. The resultant force due to surface tension, `f_T`, is directed vertically downwards. The atmospheric force `f_A` is also downwards.
***
**Fig. 2.21 (b) : Convex surface.**
Surface of the liquid in the Fig.2.21 (b) is upper convex. (Convex, when seen from above). In this case, the resultant force due to surface tension, `f_T`, on the molecule at B is vertically downwards and adds up to the downward force `f_A`. This develops greater pressure at point B, which is inside the liquid and on the concave side of the meniscus. Thus, the pressure on the concave side i.e., inside the liquid is greater than that on the convex side i.e., outside the liquid.

**c) Concave liquid surface:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.21 (c): Concave Surface.**
A concave liquid surface is shown. A molecule B is just below the surface. The resultant force due to surface tension, `f_T`, is directed vertically upwards. The atmospheric force `f_A` is downwards.
***
**Fig. 2.21 (c): Concave Surface.**
Surface of the liquid in the Fig. 2.21 (c) is upper concave (concave, when seen from above). In this case, the force due to surface tension `f_T`, on the molecule at B is vertically upwards. The force `f_A` due to atmospheric pressure acts downwards. Forces `f_A` and `f_T` thus, act in opposite direction. Therefore, the net downward force responsible for the pressure at B is less than `f_A`. This develops a lesser pressure at point B, which is inside the liquid and on the convex side of the meniscus. Thus, the pressure on the concave side i.e., outside the liquid, is greater than that on the convex side, i.e., inside the liquid.

### 2.4.6 Explanation of formation of drops and bubbles:
Liquid drops and small bubbles are spherical in shape because the forces of surface tension dominate the gravitational force. These force always try to minimize the surface area of the liquid. A bubble or drop does not collapse because the resultant of the force due to external pressure and the force of surface tension is smaller than the pressure inside a bubble or inside a liquid drop.

---
*Page 40*
---

Consider a spherical drop as shown in Fig. 2.22. Let pᵢ be the pressure inside the drop and pₒ be the pressure out side it. As the drop is spherical in shape, the pressure, pᵢ, inside the drop is greater than pₒ, the pressure outside. Therefore, the excess pressure inside the drop is pᵢ - pₒ.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.22. Excess pressure inside a liquid drop.**
A spherical liquid drop is shown. The pressure inside is pᵢ and the pressure outside is pₒ. The initial radius is r. It expands to a new radius r + Δr.
***
**Fig. 2.22. Excess pressure inside a liquid drop.**

Let the radius of the drop increase from r to r + ∆r, where ∆r is very small, so that the pressure inside the drop remains almost constant.
Let the initial surface area of the drop be A₁ = 4πr², and the final surface area of the drop be A₂ = 4π(r+∆r)².
`∴ A₂ = 4π(r² + 2r∆r + ∆r²)`
`∴ A₂ = 4πr² + 8πr∆r + 4π∆r²`
As ∆r is very small, ∆r² can be neglected,
`∴ A₂ = 4πr² + 8πr∆r`
Thus, increase in the surface area of the drop is
`dA = A₂ - A₁ = 8πr∆r` --- (2.19)
Work done in increasing the surface area by dA is stored as excess surface energy.
`∴ dW = TdA = T (8πr∆r)` --- (2.20)
This work done is also equal to the product of the force F which causes increase in the area of the drop and the displacement ∆r which is the increase in the radius of the bubble.
`∴ dW = F∆r` --- (2.21)
The excess force is given by,
(Excess pressure) × (Surface area)
`∴ F = (pᵢ - pₒ) 4πr²` --- (2.22)
Equating Eq. (2.20) and Eq. (2.21), we get,
`T(8πr∆r) = (pᵢ - pₒ) 4πr²∆r`
`∴ (pᵢ - pₒ) = 2T/r` --- (2.23)
This equation gives the excess pressure inside a drop. This is called Laplace's law of a spherical membrane.
In case of a soap bubble there are two free surfaces in contact with air, the inner surface and the outer surface. For a bubble, Eq. (2.19) changes to `dA = 2(8πr∆r)`. Hence, total increase in the surface area of a soap bubble, while increasing its radius by ∆r, is 2(8πr∆r).
The work done by this excess pressure is
`dW = (pᵢ - pₒ) 4πr²∆r = T(16πr∆r)`
`∴ (pᵢ - pₒ) = 4T/r` --- (2.24)

**Example 2.6:** What should be the diameter of a water drop so that the excess pressure inside it is 80 N/m²? (Surface tension of water = 7.27 × 10⁻² N/m)
**Solution:** Given
pᵢ - pₒ = 80 N/m²
T = 7.27 × 10⁻² N/m
We have,
`(pᵢ - pₒ) = 2T/r`
`∴ r = 2T / (pᵢ - pₒ) = (2 × 7.27 × 10⁻²) / 80 = 1.818 × 10⁻⁴ m`
`∴ d = 2r = 3.636 × 10⁻⁴ m`

### 2.4.7 Capillary Action:
A tube having a very fine bore (~ 1 mm) and open at both ends is called a **capillary tube**. If one end of a capillary tube is dipped in a liquid which partially or completely wets the surface of the capillary (like water in glass) the level of liquid in the capillary rises. On the

other hand, if the capillary tube is dipped in a liquid which does not wet its surface (like mercury in glass) the level of liquid in the capillary drops.
The phenomenon of rise or fall of a liquid inside a capillary tube when it is dipped in the liquid is called **capillarity**. Capillarity is in action when,
- Oil rises up the wick of a lamp.
- Cloth rag sucks water.
- Water rises up the crevices in rocks.
- Sap and water rise up to the top most leaves in a tree.
- Blotting paper absorbs ink.
When a capillary is dipped in a liquid, two effects can be observed, a) The liquid level can rise in the capillary (water in a glass capillary), or b) The liquid level can fall in the capillary (mercury in glass capillary). Here we discuss a qualitative argument to explain the capillary fall.

**a) Capillary fall:**
Consider a capillary tube dipped in a liquid which does not wet the surface, for example, in mercury. The shape of mercury meniscus in the capillary is upper convex. Consider the points A, B, C, and D such that, (see Fig. 2.23 (a)).
i) Point A is just above the convex surface and inside the capillary.
ii) Point B is just below the convex surface inside the capillary.
iii) Point C is just above the plane surface outside the capillary.
iv) Point D is just below the plane surface and outside the capillary, and below the point C.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.23 (a): Capillary just immersed in mercury.**
A capillary tube is shown just immersed in mercury. The mercury level inside and outside is the same. The meniscus inside the tube is convex. Points A, B, C, D are marked. A is above the meniscus inside the tube. B is below the meniscus inside the tube. C is above the flat surface outside the tube. D is below the flat surface outside the tube, at the same level as B.
***
**Fig. 2.23 (a): Capillary just immersed in mercury.**

Let p_A, p_B, p_C, and p_D be the values of the pressures at the points A, B, C, and D respectively. As discussed previously, the pressure on the concave side is always greater than that on the convex side.
`∴ p_B > p_A`
As the points A and C are at the same level, the pressure at both these points is the same, and it is the atmospheric pressure.
`∴ p_A = p_C` --- (2.25)
Between the points C and D, the surface is plane.
`∴ p_C = p_D = p_A` --- (2.26)
`∴ p_B > p_D`. But the points B and D are at the same horizontal level. Thus, in order to maintain the same pressure, the mercury in the capillary rushes out of the capillary. Because of this, there is a drop in the level of mercury inside the capillary as shown in Fig. 2.23 (b).

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.23 (b): Capillary in mercury, drop in level.**
The same setup as before, but after equilibrium is reached. The mercury level inside the capillary tube is lower than the level outside. The points A, B, C, D are shown in their respective positions.
***
**Fig. 2.23 (b): Capillary in mercury, drop in level.**

**b) Capillary rise:**
Refer to Fig. 2.24 (a) and Fig. 2.24 (b) and explain the rise of a liquid inside a capillary.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.24 (a): Capillary just immersed in water.**
A capillary tube is shown just immersed in water. The water level inside and outside is the same. The meniscus is concave. Points A, B, C, D are marked similarly to the mercury case.
***
**Fig. 2.24 (a): Capillary just immersed in water.**

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.24 (b): Capillary in water after rise in level.**
The same setup as before, but after equilibrium is reached. The water level inside the capillary tube has risen to a height 'h' above the outside level.
***
**Fig. 2.24 (b): Capillary in water after rise in level.**

**Expression for capillary rise or fall:**
**Method (I): Using pressure difference**
The pressure due to the liquid (water) column of height h must be equal to the pressure difference 2T/R due to the concavity.
`∴ hρg = 2T/R` --- (2.27)

---
*Page 42*
---
where, ρ is the density of the liquid and g is acceleration due to gravity.
Let r be the radius of the capillary tube and θ be the angle of contact of the liquid as shown in Fig. 2.25 (a).

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.25 (a): Forces acting at the point of contact.**
A magnified view of the meniscus in a capillary tube. R is the radius of curvature of the meniscus. r is the radius of the capillary tube. θ is the angle of contact. The relation r = R cosθ is shown from the geometry.
***
**Fig. 2.25 (a): Forces acting at the point of contact.**

Then radius of curvature R of the meniscus is given by `R = r/cosθ`.
`∴ hρg = 2T cosθ / r`
`∴ h = (2T cosθ) / (rρg)` --- (2.28)
The above equation gives the expression for capillary rise (or fall) for a liquid. Narrower the tube, the greater is the height to which the liquid rises (or falls).
If the capillary tube is held vertical in a liquid that has a convex meniscus, then the angle of contact θ is obtuse. Therefore, cosθ is negative and so is h. This means that the liquid will suffer capillary fall or depression.

**b) (Method II): Using forces:**
Rise of water inside a capillary is against gravity. Hence, weight of the liquid column must be equal and opposite to the proper component of force due to surface tension at the point of contact.

***
**Image Description: Fig 2.25 (b): Forces acting on liquid inside a capillary.**
A diagram of the liquid column that has risen in a capillary. The upward force due to surface tension is shown. The force `f_T` acts along the tangent at the contact line. Its vertical component is `f_T cosθ` and horizontal component is `f_T sinθ`. The downward force is the weight of the liquid column, mg.
***
**Fig 2.25 (b): Forces acting on liquid inside a capillary.**

The length of liquid in contact inside the capillary is the circumference 2πr. Thus, the force due to surface tension is given by,
`f_T = (surface tension) × (length in contact)`
`= T × 2πr`
Direction of this force is along the tangent, as shown in the Fig. 2.25 (b).
Vertical component of this force is
`(f_T)_v = T × 2πr × cosθ` --- (2.29)
Ignoring the liquid in the concave meniscus, the volume of the liquid in the capillary rise is `V = πr²h`.
`∴` Mass of the liquid in the capillary rise, `m = πr²hρ`
`∴` Weight of the liquid in the capillary (rise or fall), `w = πr²hρg` --- (2.30)
This must be equal and opposite to the vertical component of the force due to surface tension. Thus, equating right sides of equations (2.29) and (2.30), we get,
`πr²hρg = T × 2πr × cosθ`
`∴ h = (2Tcosθ) / (rρg)`
In terms of capillary rise, the expression for surface tension is,
`T = (rhρg) / (2cosθ)` --- (2.31)
The same expression is also valid for capillary fall discussed earlier.

**Example 2.7:** A capillary tube of radius 5 x 10⁻⁴ m is immersed in a beaker filled with mercury. The mercury level inside the tube is found to be 8 × 10⁻³ m below the level of reservoir. Determine the angle of contact between mercury and glass. Surface tension of mercury is 0.465 N/m and its density is 13.6 × 10³ kg/m³. (g = 9.8 m/s²)
**Solution:** Given,
r = 5 × 10⁻⁴ m
h = -8 × 10⁻³ m
T = 0.465 N/m
g = 9.8 m/s²
ρ = 13.6 × 10³ kg/m³
we have, `T = (hrρg) / (2cosθ)`
`∴ 0.465 = (-8×10⁻³ × 5×10⁻⁴ × 13.6×10³ × 9.8) / (2cosθ)`
`∴ cosθ = (-40 × 9.8 × 13.6 × 10⁻⁴) / (2 × 0.465)`
`∴ cosθ = -0.5732`
`∴ cos(π−θ) = 0.5732`
`∴ 180° - θ = 55° 2'`
`∴ θ = 124° 58'`

## 2.5 Fluids in Motion:
We come across moving fluids in our day to day life. The flow of water through our taps, the flow of cooking gas through tubes, or the flow of water through a river or a canal can be understood using the concepts developed in this section.
The branch of Physics which deals with the study of properties of fluids in motion is called **hydrodynamics**. As the study of motion of real fluid is very complicated, we shall limit our study to the motion of an ideal fluid. We have discussed an ideal fluid in the beginning of this Chapter. Study of a fluid in motion is very important.
Consider Fig. 2.26 which shows a pipe whose direction and cross sectional area change arbitrarily. The direction of flow of the fluid in pipe is as shown. We assume an ideal fluid to flow through the pipe. We define a few terms used to describe flow of a fluid.

**Steady flow:** Measurable property, such as pressure or velocity of the fluid at a given point is constant over time.
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.26: Flow lines and flow tube.**
A tube of varying cross-section is shown. Inside the tube, several curved lines with arrows indicate the direction of fluid flow. These are flow lines. A bundle of these flow lines forms an imaginary tube, called a flow tube. Area A is a cross-section of the flow tube.
***
**Fig. 2.26: Flow lines and flow tube.**

**Flow line:** It is the path of an individual particle in a moving fluid as shown in Fig. 2.26.
**Streamline:** It is a curve whose tangent at any point in the flow is in the direction of the velocity of the flow at that point. Streamlines and flow lines are identical for a steady flow.
**Flow tube:** It is an imaginary bundle of flow lines bound by an imaginary wall. For a steady flow, the fluid cannot cross the walls of a flow tube. Fluids in adjacent flow tubes cannot mix.
**Laminar flow/Streamline flow:** It is a steady flow in which adjacent layers of a fluid move smoothly over each other as shown in Fig. 2.27 (a). A steady flow of river can be assumed to be a laminar flow.
**Turbulent flow:** It is a flow at a very high flow rate so that there is no steady flow and the flow pattern changes continuously as shown in Fig. 2.27 (b). A flooded river flow or a tap running very fast is a turbulent flow.

**Table 2.3 Streamline Flow and Turbulent Flow**
| Streamline flow | Turbulent flow |
|---|---|
| 1) The smooth flow of a fluid, with velocity smaller than certain critical velocity (limiting value of velocity) is called streamline flow or laminar flow of a fluid. | 1) The irregular and unsteady flow of a fluid when its velocity increases beyond critical velocity is called turbulent flow. |
| 2) In a streamline flow, velocity of a fluid at a given point is always constant. | 2) In a turbulent flow, the velocity of a fluid at any point does not remain constant. |
| 3) Two streamlines can never intersect, i.e., they are always parallel. | 3) In a turbulent flow, at some points, the fluid may have rotational motion which gives rise to eddies. |
| 4) Streamline flow over a plane surface can be assumed to be divided into a number of plane layers. In a flow of liquid through a pipe of uniform cross sectional area, all the streamlines will be parallel to the axis of the tube. | 4) A flow tube loses its order and particles move in random direction. |

## 2.6 Critical Velocity and Reynolds number:
The flow of a fluid, whether streamline or turbulent, is differentiated on the basis of velocity of the flow. The velocity beyond which a streamline flow becomes turbulent is called **critical velocity**.
According to Osborne Reynolds (1842 - 1912), critical velocity is given by
`v_c = R_n η / (ρd)` --- (2.32)
where,
`v_c` = critical velocity of the fluid
`R_n` = Reynolds number
η = coefficient of viscosity
ρ = density of fluid
d = diameter of tube
From Eq. (2.32) equation for Reynolds number can be written as,
`R_n = v_c ρd / η` --- (2.33)
Reynolds number is a pure number. It has no unit and dimensions. It is found that for R_n less than 1000, the flow of a fluid is streamline while for R_n greater than 2000, the flow of fluid is turbulent. When R_n is between 1000 and 2000, the flow of fluid becomes unsteady, i.e., it changes from a streamline flow to a turbulent flow.

### 2.6.1 Viscosity:
When we pour water from a glass, it flows freely and quickly. But when we pour syrup or honey, it flows slowly and sticks to the container. The difference is due to fluid friction. This friction is both within the fluid itself and between the fluid and its surroundings. This property of fluids is called **viscosity**. Water has low viscosity, whereas syrup or honey has high viscosity. Figure 2.28 shows a schematic section of viscous flow and Fig. 2.29 that of a non viscous flow. Note that there is no dragging force in the non-viscous flow, and all layers are moving with the same velocity.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.28: Viscous flow.**
Several horizontal layers of fluid are shown flowing to the right. The length of the velocity vectors (arrows) is different for each layer. The central layer has the longest arrow (fastest), and the layers closer to the top and bottom have progressively shorter arrows (slower). The outermost layers are the slowest.
***
**Fig. 2.28: Viscous flow. Different layers flow with different velocities. The central layer flows the fastest and the outermost layers flow the slowest.**

Viscosity of such fluid is zero. The only fluid that is almost non-viscous is liquid helium at about 2K. In this section, we will study viscosity of a fluid and how it affects the flow of a fluid.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.29: Non-viscous flow.**
Several horizontal layers of fluid are shown flowing to the right. All velocity vectors have the same length, indicating all layers move with the same velocity.
***
**Fig. 2.29: Non-viscous flow. Different layers flow with the same velocity.**

If we observe the flow of river water, it is found that the water near both sides of the river bank flows slow and as we move towards the center of the river, the water flows faster gradually. At the centre, the flow is the fastest. From this observation it is clear that there is some opposing force between two adjacent layers of fluids which affects their relative motion.

---
*Page 45*
---

**Viscosity** is that property of fluid, by virtue of which, the relative motion between different layers of a fluid experience a dragging force. This force is called the **viscous drag**. This is shown schematically in Fig. 2.30.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.30: Change in velocity of layer as its distance from a referee layer changes.**
A stationary layer is shown at the bottom. Above it are several layers of fluid moving to the right. The velocity of the layers increases with distance 'x' from the stationary layer. A layer at distance x has velocity v. A layer at x+dx has velocity v+dv. A layer at x-dx has velocity v-dv.
***
**Fig. 2.30: Change in velocity of layer as its distance from a referee layer changes.**

In liquids, the viscous drag is due to short range molecular cohesive forces, and in gases it is due to collisions between fast moving molecules. In both liquids and gases, as long as the relative velocity between the layers is small, the viscous drag is proportional to the relative velocity. However, in a turbulent flow, the viscous drag increases rapidly and is not proportional to relative velocity but proportional to higher powers of relative velocity.
**Velocity gradient:** The rate of change of velocity (dv) with distance (dx) measured from a stationary layer is called **velocity gradient (dv/dx)**.

### 2.6.2 Coefficient of viscosity:
According to Newton's law of viscosity, for a streamline flow, viscous force (f) acting on any layer is directly proportional to the area (A) of the layer and the velocity gradient (dv/dx) i.e.,
`f ∝ A(dv/dx)`
`∴ f = ηA(dv/dx)` --- (2.34)
where η is a constant, called **coefficient of viscosity** of the liquid. From Eq. (2.34) we can write,
`η = f / (A(dv/dx))` --- (2.35)
*Note: 'A' in this expression is not the cross sectional area, it is the area of the layer, parallel to the direction of the flow.*

The coefficient of viscosity can be defined as the viscous force per unit area per unit velocity gradient. S.I. unit of viscosity is Ns/m².

> CGS unit of viscosity is Poise. Find the relation between Poise and the SI unit of viscosity.

**A Microscopic View of Viscosity:**
Viscosity of a fluid can be explained on the basic of molecular motion as follow. Consider the laminar flow between plats X and Y as shown in the figure. Plate X is stationary and plate Y moves with a velocity v₀. Layers a, b, and c move with velocity, v-dv, v, and v + dv respectively. Consider two adjacent layers, b and c. The velocity of the fluid is equal to mean velocity of the molecules contained in that layer. Thus, the mean velocity of the molecules in layer b is v, while the molecules in layers c have a slightly greater mean velocity v + dv. As you will learn in the next chapter, each molecule possesses a random velocity whose magnitude is usually larger than that of the mean velocity. As a result, molecules are continually transferred in large numbers between the two layers. On the average, molecules passing from layer c to layer b will be moving too fast for their 'new' layer by an amount dv and will slow down as a result of collisions with the molecules in layer b. The result is a transfer of momentum from faster-moving layers c to their neighboring slower-moving layers such as b and thus eventually to plate X. Because the original source of this transfer of momentum is plate Y, the overall result is a transfer of momentum from plate Y

***
**Image Description: Microscopic View of Viscosity diagram**
Two parallel plates, Plate X (bottom, stationary) and Plate Y (top, moving), are shown. Between them are layers of fluid labeled a, b, c.
- Plate Y moves with velocity v₀.
- Layer c moves with velocity v + dv.
- Layer b moves with velocity v.
- Layer a moves with velocity v - dv.
- Plate X is stationary.
The velocity decreases linearly from Plate Y to Plate X.
***

*Page 46*
---

to plate X. If there are no external forces applied, this momentum transfer would reduce speed of the plate Y to zero with respect to the plate X.
Reduction in the velocity of the molecules in the direction of laminar flow is due to the fact that their directions after collision are random. This randomness, to be discussed in Chapter 3, results in an increase in the thermal energy of the fluid at the cost of its macroscopic kinetic energy. That is, the process is dissipative, or frictional.
In liquids there is an additional, stronger interaction between molecules in adjacent layers, due to the intermolecular forces that distinguish liquid from gases. As a result, there is a transfer of momentum from faster-moving layers to slower-moving layers, which results in a viscous drag.

> **Remember this**
>
> Coefficient of viscosity of a fluid changes with change in its temperature. For most liquids, the coefficient of viscosity decreases with increase in their temperature. It probably depends on the fact that at higher temperatures, the molecules are farther apart and the cohesive forces or inter-molecular forces are, therefore, less effective. Whereas, in gases, the coefficient of viscosity increases with the increase in temperature. This is because, at high temperatures, the molecules move faster and collide more often with each other, giving rise to increased internal friction.

**Table 2.4 Coefficient of viscosity at different temperatures.**
| Fluid | Temperature | Coefficient of Viscosity Ns/m² |
|---|---|---|
| Air | 0°C | 0.017 x 10⁻³ |
| | 40°C | 0.019 x 10⁻³ |
| Water | 20°C | 1 x 10⁻³ |
| | 100°C | 0.3 x 10⁻³ |
| Machine oil | 16°C | 0.113 |
| | 38°C | 0.034 |
*(Note: The textbook seems to have a typo for the machine oil viscosity units. They should likely be consistent with the others, perhaps x 10⁻³ is missing or the values are in a different unit not specified.)*

## 2.7 Stokes' Law:
In 1845, Sir George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903) stated the law which gives the viscous force acting on a spherical object falling through a viscous medium (see Fig. 2.31).
***
**Image Description: Fig 2.31: Spherical object moving through a viscous medium.**
A sphere is shown moving downwards through a fluid. Streamlines are drawn around the sphere, indicating the flow of the fluid past the object. An upward arrow labeled Fᵥ represents the viscous force acting on the sphere.
***
**Fig 2.31: Spherical object moving through a viscous medium.**

The law states that, **“The viscous force (Fᵥ) acting on a small sphere falling through a viscous medium is directly proportional to the radius of the sphere (r), its velocity (v) through the fluid, and the coefficient of viscosity (η) of the fluid”**.
`∴ Fᵥ ∝ ηrv`
The empirically obtained constant of proportionality is 6π.
`∴ Fᵥ = 6πηrv` --- (2.36)
This is the expression for viscous force acting on a spherical object moving through a viscous medium. The above formula can be derived using dimensional analysis.

**Example 2.8:** A steel ball with radius 0.3 mm is falling with velocity of 2 m/s at a time t, through a tube filled with glycerin, having coefficient of viscosity 0.833 Ns/m². Determine viscous force acting on the steel ball at that time.
**Solution:** Given
r = 0.3 mm = 0.3 × 10⁻³ m, v = 2 m/s, η = 0.833 N s/m².
We have, `F = 6πηrv`
`F = 6 x 3.142 × 0.833 x 0.3 × 10⁻³ × 2`
`Therefore, F = 9.422 × 10⁻³ N`

### 2.7.1 Terminal Velocity:
Consider a spherical object falling through a viscous fluid. Forces experienced by it during its downward motion are,
1. Viscous force (Fᵥ), directed upwards. Its magnitude goes on increasing with increase in its velocity.

---
*Page 47*
---

2. Gravitational force, or its weight (F₉), directed downwards, and
3. Buoyant force or upthrust (Fᵤ), directed upwards.
Net downward force given by `f = F₉ - (Fᵥ + Fᵤ)`, is responsible for initial increase in the velocity. Among the given forces, F₉ and Fᵤ are constant while Fᵥ increases with increase in velocity. Thus, a stage is reached when the net force f becomes zero. At this stage, `F₉ = Fᵥ + Fᵤ`. After that, the downward velocity remains constant. This constant downward velocity is called **terminal velocity**. Obviously, now onwards, the viscous force Fᵥ is also constant. *The entire discussion necessarily applies to streamline flow only.*

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.32: Forces acting on object moving through a viscous medium.**
A spherical object is shown submerged in a fluid. Three forces are acting on it:
1. `mg downward (F₉)`: Gravitational force, acting downwards.
2. `Upthrust (Fᵤ)`: Buoyant force, acting upwards.
3. `Viscous force (Fᵥ)`: Viscous drag, acting upwards.
***
**Fig. 2.32: Forces acting on object moving through a viscous medium.**

Consider a spherical object falling under gravity through a viscous medium as shown in Fig. 2.32. Let the radius of the sphere be r, its mass m and density ρ. Let the density of the medium be σ and its coefficient of viscosity be η. When the sphere attains the terminal velocity, the total downward force acting on the sphere is balanced by the total upward force acting on the sphere.
Total downward force = Total upward force
weight of sphere (mg) = viscous force + buoyant force due to the medium
`mg = Fᵥ + Fᵤ`
`(4/3)πr³ρg = 6πηrv + (4/3)πr³σg`
`6πηrv = (4/3)πr³ρg - (4/3)πr³σg`
`6πηrv = (4/3)πr³(ρ-σ)g`
`v = (4/3)πr³g(ρ-σ) × (1 / 6πηr)`
`v = (2/9) r²g(ρ-σ) / η` --- (2.37)
This is the expression for the terminal velocity of the sphere. From Eq. (2.37) we can also write,
`η = (2/9) r²(ρ-σ)g / v` --- (2.38)
The above equation gives coefficient of viscosity of a fluid.

**Example 2.9:** A spherical drop of oil falls at a constant speed of 4 cm/s in steady air. Calculate the radius of the drop. The density of the oil is 0.9 g/cm³, density of air is 0.0013 g/cm³ and the coefficient of viscosity of air is 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ poise, (g = 980 cm/s²)
**Solution:** Given,
v = 4 cm/s
η = 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ Poise
ρ = 0.9 g/cm³
σ = 0.0013 g/cm³
We have, `η = (2/9) r²(ρ-σ)g / v`
`∴ r = √[ (9ηv) / (2(ρ-σ)g) ]`
`r = √[ (9 × 1.8×10⁻⁴ × 4) / (2 × (0.9 - 0.0013) × 980) ]`
`∴ r = 1.356 × 10⁻³ cm`

> **Remember this**
>
> The velocity with which an object can move through a viscous fluid is always less than or equal to the terminal velocity in that fluid for that object.

## 2.8 Equation of Continuity:
Consider a steady flow of an incompressible fluid as shown in Fig. 2.33. For a steady flow, the velocity of a particle remains constant at a given point but it can vary from point to point. For example, consider section A₁ and A₂ in Fig. 2.33. Section A₁ has larger cross sectional area than the section A₂. Let v₁ and v₂ be the velocities of the fluid at sections A₁ and A₂, respectively.
This is because, a particle has to move faster in the narrower section (where there is

**Image Description: Fig. 2.33: Steady flow fluid.**
A tube of varying cross-section is shown, narrower at the right end. At the wider end (point A), the cross-sectional area is A₁ and the fluid velocity is v₁. The fluid covers a distance v₁Δt in time Δt. At the narrower end (point B), the cross-sectional area is A₂ and the fluid velocity is v₂. The fluid covers a distance v₂Δt in time Δt. A section of the fluid between EFGH and PQRS is shown.

less space) to accommodate particles behind it hence its velocity increases. When a particle enters a wider section, it slows down because there is more space. Because the fluid is incompressible, the particles moves faster through a narrow section and slow down while moving through wider section. If the fluid does not move faster in a narrow region, it will be compressed to fit into the narrow space.
Consider a tube of flow as shown in Fig. 2.33. All the fluid that passes through a tube of flow must pass through any cross section that cuts the tube of flow. We know that all the fluid is confined to the tube of flow. Fluid can not leave the tube or enter the tube.
Consider section A₁ and A₂ located at points A and B respectively as shown in Fig. 2.33. Matter is neither created nor destroyed within the tube enclosed between section A₁ and A₂. Therefore, the mass of the fluid within this region is constant over time. That means, if mass m of the fluid enters the section A₁, then equal mass of fluid should leave the section A₂.
Let the speed of the fluid which crosses the section EFGH at point A in time interval ∆t be v₁. Thus, the mass of the fluid entering the tube through the cross section at point A is ρA₁v₁∆t. Similarly, let the speed of the fluid be v₂ at point B. The fluid crosses the section PQRS of area A₂ in time interval ∆t. Thus, the mass of the fluid leaving the tube through the cross section at B is ρA₂v₂∆t.
As fluid is incompressible, the mass of the fluid entering the tube at point A is the same as the mass leaving the tube at B.
Mass of the fluid in section EFGH = mass of fluid in section PQRS
`ρA₁v₁∆t = ρA₂v₂∆t` --- (2.39)
`A₁v₁ = A₂v₂ or, Av = constant` --- (2.40)
Av is the volume rate of flow of a fluid, i.e., `Av = dV/dt`. The quantity `dV/dt` is the volume of a fluid per unit time passing through any cross section of the tube of flow. It is called the **volume flux**. Similarly, `ρ(dV/dt) = dm/dt` is called **mass flux**.
Equation (2.40) is called the **equation of continuity** in fluid dynamics. The continuity equation says that the volume rate of flow of an incompressible fluid for a steady flow is the same throughout the flow.

> When water is released from a dam, the amount of water is mentioned in terms of Thousand Million Cubic feet (TMC). One TMC is 10⁹ cubic feet of water per second. Basic unit of measuring flow is cusec. One cusec is one cubic feet per sec (28.317 lit per sec).

**Example 2.10:** As shown in the given figure, a piston of cross sectional area 2 cm² pushes the liquid out of a tube whose area at the outlet is 40 mm². The piston is pushed at a rate of 2 cm/s. Determine the speed at which the fluid leaves the tube.
***
**Image Description: Piston and nozzle.**
A large cylinder with a piston on the left pushes fluid into a narrow tube that opens into multiple small outlets on the right, resembling a shower head.
***
**Solution:** Given,
A₁ = 2 cm² = 2 × 10⁻⁴ m²
v₁ = 2 cm/s = 2 × 10⁻² m/s
A₂ = 40 mm² = 40 × 10⁻⁶ m²
From equation of continuity, A₁v₁ = A₂v₂
Therefore,
`v₂ = (A₁v₁) / A₂ = (2×10⁻⁴ × 2×10⁻²) / (40×10⁻⁶) = 0.1 m/s`

## 2.9 Bernoulli's Equation:
On observing a river, we notice that the speed of the water decreases in wider region whereas the speed of water increases in the regions where the river is narrow. From this we might think that the pressure in narrower regions is more than that in the wider region. However, the pressure within the fluid in the narrower parts is less while that in wider parts is more.
Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), while experimenting with fluid inside pipes led to the discovery of the concept mentioned above. He observed, in his experiment, that the speed of a fluid in a narrow region increases but the internal pressure of a fluid in the same narrow region decreases. This phenomenon is called **Bernoulli's principle**.

***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.34: Flow of fluid through a tube of varying cross section and height.**
A tube is shown with a varying cross-section and height. The left end (P) is lower and wider, while the right end (R) is higher and narrower.
- At the lower end P: cross-section A₁, velocity v₁, pressure P₁, height h₁. A force P₁A₁ acts on the fluid. The fluid moves a distance d₁.
- At the upper end R: cross-section A₂, velocity v₂, pressure P₂, height h₂. A force P₂A₂ opposes the fluid motion. The fluid moves a distance d₂.
A fluid element between sections P and R is considered.
***
**Fig. 2.34: Flow of fluid through a tube of varying cross section and height.**

Bernoulli's equation relates the speed of a fluid at a point, the pressure at that point and the height of that point above a reference level. It is an application of work – energy theorem for a fluid in flow. As Bernoulli's principle is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy, we shall derive it using pressure energy, kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.
Figure 2.34 shows flow of an ideal fluid through a tube of varying cross section and height. Consider an element of fluid that lies between cross sections P and R.
Let,
- v₁ and v₂ be the speed of the fluid at the lower end P and the upper end R respectively.
- A₁ and A₂ be the cross section area of the fluid at the lower end P and the upper end R respectively.
- P₁ and P₂ be the pressures of the fluid at the lower end P and the upper R respectively.
- d₁ and d₂ be the distances travelled by the fluid at the lower end P and the upper end R during the time interval dt with velocities v₁ and v₂ respectively.
Now P₁A₁ and P₂A₂ are the forces acting on areas A₁ at P and A₂ at R respectively.
The volume dV of the fluid passing through any cross section during time interval dt is the same; i.e.,
`dV = A₁d₁ = A₂d₂` --- (2.41)
There is no internal friction in the fluid as the fluid is ideal. In practice also, for a fluid like water, the loss in energy due to viscous force is negligible. So the only non-gravitational force that does work on the fluid element is due to the pressure of the surrounding fluid. Therefore, the net work, W, done on the element by the surrounding fluid during the flow from P to R is,
`W = P₁A₁d₁ – P₂A₂d₂`
The second term in the above equation has a negative sign because the force at R opposes the displacement of the fluid. From Eq. (2.41) the above equation can be written as,
`W = P₁dV - P₂dV`
`∴ W = (P₁ - P₂)dV` --- (2.42)
As the work W is due to forces other than the conservative force of gravity, it equals the change in the total mechanical energy i.e., kinetic energy plus gravitational potential energy associated with the fluid element.
i.e., `W = ΔK.E. + ΔP.E.` --- (2.43)
The mechanical energy for the fluid between sections Q and R does not change.

---
*Page 50*
---

At the beginning of the time interval dt, the mass and the kinetic energy of the fluid between P and Q is, `ρA₁d₁` and `(1/2)ρ(A₁d₁)v₁²` respectively. At the end of the time interval dt, the kinetic energy of the fluid between section R and S is `(1/2)ρ(A₂d₂)v₂²`. Therefore, the net change in the kinetic energy, ΔK.E., during time interval dt is,
`ΔK.E. = (1/2)ρ(A₂d₂)v₂² - (1/2)ρ(A₁d₁)v₁²`
`ΔK.E. = (1/2)ρdVv₂² - (1/2)ρdVv₁²`
`ΔK.E. = (1/2)ρdV(v₂² - v₁²)` --- (2.44)
Also, at the beginning of the time interval dt, the gravitational potential energy of the mass m between P and Q is `mgh₁ = ρdVgh₁`. At the end of the interval dt, the gravitational potential energy of the mass m between R and S is `mgh₂ = ρdVgh₂`. Therefore, the net change in the gravitational potential energy, ΔP.E., during time interval dt is,
`ΔP.E. = ρdVgh₂ - ρdVgh₁`
`ΔP.E. = ρdVg(h₂ - h₁)` --- (2.45)
Substituting Eq. (2.42), (2.44) and (2.45) in Eq. (2.43) we get,
`(P₁ - P₂)dV = (1/2)ρdV(v₂² - v₁²) + ρdVg(h₂ - h₁)`
`∴ (P₁ - P₂) = (1/2)ρ(v₂² - v₁²) + ρg(h₂ - h₁)` --- (2.46)
This is Bernoulli's equation. It states that the work done per unit volume of a fluid by the surrounding fluid is equal to the sum of the changes in kinetic and potential energies per unit volume that occur during the flow. Equation (2.46) can also be written as,
`P₁ + (1/2)ρv₁² + ρgh₁ = P₂ + (1/2)ρv₂² + ρgh₂` --- (2.47)
or, `P + (1/2)ρv² + ρgh = constant` --- (2.48)

> **A different way of interpreting the Bernoulli's equation:**
> `(P₁ - P₂) = (1/2)ρ(v₂² - v₁²) + ρg(h₂ - h₁)`
> Dimensionally, pressure is energy per unit volume. Both terms on the right side of the above equation have dimensions of energy per unit volume. Hence, quite often, the left side is referred to as pressure energy per unit volume. The left side of equation is called pressure head. The first term on the right side is called the velocity head and the second term is called the potential head.
> **In other words, the Bernoulli's principle is thus consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.**

**Example 2.11:** The given figure shows a streamline flow of a non-viscous liquid having density 1000 kg/m³. The cross sectional area at point A is 2 cm² and at point B is 1 cm². The speed of liquid at the point A is 5 cm/s. Both points A and B are at the same horizontal level. Calculate the difference in pressure at A and B.
***
**Image Description:** A horizontal tube with a wider section at point A and a narrower section at point B.
***
**Solution:** Given,
ρ = 1000 kg/m³, A₁ = 2 cm² = 2 × 10⁻⁴ m²
A₂ = 1 cm² = 10⁻⁴ m², v₁ = 5 cm/s = 5 × 10⁻² m/s and h₁ = h₂
From the equation of continuity, `A₁v₁ = A₂v₂`
`∴ v₂ = (A₁v₁) / A₂ = (2 × 10⁻⁴ × 5 × 10⁻²) / (10⁻⁴) = 0.1 m/s = 10 cm/s`
By Bernoulli's equation,
`(P₁ - P₂) = (1/2)ρ(v₂² - v₁²)` + `ρg(h₂ - h₁)`
(since, h₂ - h₁ = 0)
`(P₁ - P₂) = (1/2)ρ(v₂² - v₁²)`
`= (1/2) × 1000 × ((0.1)² - (0.05)²) = (1/2) × 1000 × (0.01 - 0.0025) = 500 × 0.0075`
`P₁ - P₂ = 3.75 Pa`
*(Note: There is a calculation error in the textbook's solution. Using cm/s directly: (1/2) * (1 g/cm³) * (10² - 5²) = 0.5 * (100-25) = 37.5 dyne/cm² = 3.75 Pa. The textbook seems to have made a unit conversion error leading to 37500 Pa.)*

**Applications of Bernoulli's equation:**
**a) Speed of efflux:**
The word efflux means fluid out flow. Torricelli discovered that the speed of efflux from an open tank is given by a formula identical to that of a freely falling body.
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.35: Efflux of fluid from an orifice.**
A large tank with cross-sectional area A₁ is filled with a liquid to a height h above a small orifice at the bottom. The orifice has an area A₂. The liquid flows out of the orifice. The top surface of the liquid is open to the atmosphere (pressure P₀), and the stream of fluid from the orifice is also at atmospheric pressure P₀.
***
**Fig. 2.35: Efflux of fluid from an orifice.**

Consider a liquid of density 'ρ' filled in a tank of large cross-sectional area A₁ having an orifice of cross-sectional area A₂ at the bottom as shown in Fig. 2.35. Let A₂ << A₁. The liquid flows out of the tank through the orifice. Let v₁ and v₂ be the speeds of the liquid at A₁ and A₂ respectively. As both, inlet and outlet, are exposed to the atmosphere, the pressure at these position equals the atmosphere pressure p₀. If the height of the free surface above the orifice is h, Bernoulli's equation gives us,
`p₀ + (1/2)ρv₁² + ρgh = p₀ + (1/2)ρv₂²` --- (2.49)
Using equation of continuity we can write,
`v₁ = (A₂/A₁)v₂`
Substituting v₁ in Eq.(2.49) we get,
`(1/2)ρ((A₂/A₁)v₂)² + ρgh = (1/2)ρv₂²`
`(A₂/A₁)²v₂² + 2gh = v₂²`
`2gh = v₂²(1 - (A₂/A₁)²)`
`v₂² = 2gh / (1 - (A₂/A₁)²)`
If A₂ << A₁, the term (A₂/A₁)² can be neglected, and the above equation reduces to,
`v₂ = √2gh` --- (2.50)
This is the equation of the speed of a liquid flowing out through an orifice at a depth 'h' below the free surface. It is the same as that of a particle falling freely through the height 'h' under gravity.

**Example 2.12:** Doors of a dam are 20 m below the surface of water in the dam. If one door is opened, what will be the speed of the water that flows out of the door? (g = 9.8 m/s²)
**Solution:** Given, h = 20 m
From Toricelli's law,
`v = √2gh = √(2×9.8×20) = √392 = 19.79 m/s`

**b) Ventury tube:**
A ventury tube is used to measure the speed of flow of a fluid in a tube. It has a constriction in the tube. As the fluid passes through the constriction, its speed increases in accordance with the equation of continuity. The pressure thus decreases as required by the Bernoulli equation.
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.36: Ventury tube.**
A horizontal tube with a constriction in the middle. The wider part has cross-section A₁ and pressure P₁. The constricted part has cross-section A₂ and pressure P₂. Two vertical tubes are attached, one at the wide part and one at the constricted part, to act as manometers. The liquid level in the vertical tube at A₁ is higher than the level at A₂, indicating P₁ > P₂. The difference in heights is 'h'.
***
**Fig. 2.36: Ventury tube.**

The fluid of density ρ flows through the Ventury tube. The area of cross section is A₁ at wider part and A₂ at the constriction. Let the speeds of the fluid at A₁ and A₂ be v₁ and v₂, and the pressures, be p₁ and p₂ respectively. From Bernoulli's equation,
`p₁ + (1/2)ρv₁² = p₂ + (1/2)ρv₂²`
`(p₁ - p₂) = (1/2)ρ(v₂² - v₁²)` --- (2.51)
Figure 2.36 shows two vertical tubes connected

---
*Page 52*
---

to the Ventury tube at A₁ and A₂. If the difference in height of the liquid levels in the tubes is h, we have,
`(p₁ - p₂) = ρgh`
Substituting above equation in Eq. (2.51) we get,
`2gh = v₂² - v₁²` --- (2.52)
From the equation of continuity, A₁v₁ = A₂v₂, substituting v₁ in terms of v₂ or vice versa in Eq. (2.52) the rate of flow of liquid passing through a cross section can be calculated by knowing the areas A₁ and A₂.

**Example 2.13:** Water flows through a tube as shown in the given figure. Find the difference in mercury level, if the speed of flow of water at point A is 2 m/s and at point B is 5 m/s. (g = 9.8 m/s², specific gravity of mercury = 13.6)
***
**Image Description:** A horizontal pipe with a wider section at A and a narrower section at B. A U-tube manometer containing mercury is connected between points A and B. The mercury level is higher on the side connected to B.
***
**Solution:** Given, v_A = 2 m/s, v_B = 5 m/s
We have, Pressure difference in water generates level difference for the mercury in the manometer.
`ΔP = (1/2)ρ_w(v_B² - v_A²) = hρ_{Hg}g`
`∴ h = (v_B² - v_A²) / (2g(ρ_{Hg}/ρ_w))`
`h = (5² - 2²) / (2 × 9.8 × 13.6) = (25-4) / (266.56) = 21 / 266.56 = 0.07878 m`
`= 7.878 cm`

**c) Lifting up of an aeroplane:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.37: Airflow along an aerofoil.**
The cross-section of an airplane wing (aerofoil) is shown. It is curved on the top and flatter on the bottom. Streamlines of air flow are shown passing over and under the wing. The streamlines are crowded together above the wing, indicating higher speed, and are more spread out below the wing, indicating lower speed.
***
**Fig. 2.37: Airflow along an aerofoil.**

The shape of cross section of wings of an aeroplane is as shown in Fig. 2.37. When an aeroplane runs on a runway, due to aerodynamic shape of its wings, the streamlines of air are crowded above the wings compared to those below the wings. Thus, the air above the wings moves faster than that below the wings. According to the Bernoulli's principle, the pressure above the wings decreases and that below the wings does not change. Due to this pressure difference, an upward force called the **dynamic lift** acts on the bottom of the wings of a plane. When this force becomes greater than the weight of aeroplane, the aeroplane takes off.

**d) Working of an atomizer:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.38: Atomizer.**
A horizontal cylinder C with a piston P is shown. The outlet of the cylinder is positioned just above the open end of a vertical tube T. The bottom of tube T is dipped in a liquid. When the piston P is pushed, it blows air at high speed over the top of tube T.
***
**Fig. 2.38: Atomizer.**

The action of the carburetor of an automobile engine, paint-gun, scent-spray or insect-sprayer is based on the Bernoulli's principle. In all these, a tube T is dipped in a liquid as shown in Fig. 2.38. Air is blown at high speed over the tip of this tube with the help of a piston P in the cylinder C. This high speed air creates low pressure over the tube, due to which the liquid rises in it and is then blown off in very small droplets with expelled air.

**e) Blowing off of roofs by stormy wind:**
***
**Image Description: Fig. 2.39: Airflow along a roof.**
A house with a slanted roof is shown. Strong wind is blowing over the roof, creating a low-pressure region (p) above it. The pressure inside the house (p₀) remains atmospheric. The pressure difference (p₀ > p) creates an upward force on the roof.
***
**Fig. 2.39: Airflow along a roof.**

When high speed, stormy wind blows over a roof top, it causes low pressure p above the roof in accordance with the Bernoulli's principle. However, the air below the roof (i.e. inside the room) is still at the atmospheric pressure p₀. So, due to this difference in pressure, the roof is lifted up and is then blown off by the wind as shown in Fig. 2.39.

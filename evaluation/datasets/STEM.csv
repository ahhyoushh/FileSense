"In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre.

"The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties.

"Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life. Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes. Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment.

"The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour.

"The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions.

"Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search.

"When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system.

"Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties.

"Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour.

"For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis.

"When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions.

"Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions. Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation.

"Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body.

Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time.

"Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output.

"Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms.

Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition.

A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain.

When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals.

Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function.

"Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat.

Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs.

In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time.

In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants.

Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain.

In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body.

"For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system.

"When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions.

"When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time.

"Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis.

"Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants.

Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions.

Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function.

In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time.

"Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions.

"Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles.

"When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis.

"Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals.

When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems.

"Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells.

Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists.

The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants.

"Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity.

"Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point.

"Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre.

"The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point.

"Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations.

Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system.

"Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms. Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes.

"The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs.

"Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point.

"In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat.

"A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities.

"Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes. Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life. Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment.

"Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells.

Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry.

"The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists.

"Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system.

Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties.

Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible.

"Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes. Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output.

"Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre.

"Time complexity provides a way to estimate how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. In practice data structures and algorithms are chosen to balance speed, memory usage and implementation complexity. An algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined instructions that transforms given input into desired output. Sorting algorithms reorder elements in a collection so that they follow a specified comparison relation. Graph algorithms often rely on traversal strategies such as depth first search and breadth first search. Stacks operate on a last in first out discipline while queues follow a first in first out ordering of elements. Hash tables provide average constant time performance for search, insert and delete operations under suitable assumptions. Recursion allows a function to call itself on smaller instances of a problem until a base case is reached. Arrays and linked lists are fundamental linear data structures that store collections of elements in different ways. Trees are hierarchical structures made of nodes connected by edges with exactly one simple path between any two nodes.

"Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems.

A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists.

"Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre.

"Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there.

"Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs.

"Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection.

"Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products. Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible.

"Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat.

"A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there.

"When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre.

Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms.

"Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles.

"Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain.

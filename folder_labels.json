{
  "Physics": "This category is for all documents, **investigatory projects**, and **practical reports** concerning **physics**. It covers concepts in **classical mechanics**, **optics** (such as **light**, **lenses**, **refractive index**, **focal length**, and **radius of curvature**), thermodynamics (heat, engines), electromagnetism, and wave mechanics. It also includes **modern physics** and theoretical concepts like **relativity**, **quantum physics**, **astrophysics**, **wormholes**, and the **science of time travel**. This label applies to any document featuring theoretical derivations, **experimental methodology**, **abstracts**, **data tables**, **observations**, and **calculations** (e.g., using formulas for $\\mu$ or $f$), as well as project synopses or papers analyzing these scientific principles.",
  "Mathematics": "This category includes all documents centered on **mathematics**. This covers algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and number theory, as well as advanced analysis like **calculus** (differential, integral), and differential equations. It is the correct label for documents focused on **statistics**, **probability**, data analysis, and mathematical modeling. This label applies to theoretical proofs, formula sheets, problem sets, data-driven reports, and any project synopsis or paper where the primary focus is the derivation, application, or analysis of mathematical or **statistical models**.",
  "Informatic Practices": "This category is for all documents related to **Computer Science**, **Information Technology (IT)**, and **Informatic Practices**. This includes **practical files**, **coding exercises**, and project reports. It covers programming (especially **Python**), algorithms, and data structures. It heavily features **data analysis** libraries like **`pandas`** (for **DataFrames** and **Series**) and **`numpy`**, as well as **data visualization** using **`matplotlib`** (e.g., **line charts**, **bar charts**, plotting). This label also includes **database management (DBMS)**, **SQL**, and **MySQL queries** (such as **CREATE TABLE**, **INSERT**, **SELECT**, **GROUP BY**, and **JOIN**), and handling data from sources like **CSV files**.",
  "Chemistry": "This category is for all documents related to **chemistry**, including formal **lab reports**, **practical notebooks**, and experimental documentation. It covers: **Physical Chemistry** (e.g., **chemical kinetics**, **rate of reaction**, **enthalpy of neutralization**, **calorimetry**, thermochemistry); **Analytical Chemistry** (e.g., **titration** / **volumetric analysis**, finding **molarity** and **concentration** using indicators like **KMnO4**, experiments with **oxalic acid** or **F.A.S.**); **Organic Chemistry** (e.g., tests for **functional groups** like aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids); and **Inorganic Chemistry** (e.g., **qualitative analysis** or **salt analysis** for **anions** and **cations**). This label applies to any file containing **observations**, **calculations**, chemical equations, and experimental procedures.",
  "English": "This category is for all documents related to the **English language**, **literature**, and composition. This includes **project work**, **essays**, literary analysis, and criticism. It covers the study of literature (like short stories, e.g., 'The Third Level'), poetry, and drama, as well as **comprehension** and analysis of media (like **podcasts** or videos). This label is for **assessments of listening and speaking skills (ASL)**, grammar exercises, writing practice, and any synopsis or report that involves **literary analysis**, research, or **comparative discussion** (e.g., comparing literary themes like psychology or fantasy with scientific reasoning).",
  "Official Document": "This category is for formal, administrative, legal, or professional documents. This includes official **certificates** (like academic completion certificates found in project files), government-issued forms, legal contracts, agreements, notices, and letters (e.g., letters of recommendation, offer letters). It also applies to personal professional documents like **resumes (CVs)**, transcripts, and applications. Any file that serves as a formal record, certification, or legal instrument belongs here.",
  "Unsorted": "This category is a default holding area for files that do not clearly fit into any of the other defined labels (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, English, Informatic Practices, or Official Document). It is used for miscellaneous items, files pending review, or documents with ambiguous or highly interdisciplinary content that cannot be assigned to a single primary category."

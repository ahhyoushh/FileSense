Thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy help predict whether a process is feasible. Electrochemistry connects chemical change with electrical energy through galvanic cells and electrolytic cells. The structure of a molecule is interpreted using ideas of hybridisation, bond angles and electron domain geometry. The rate of a reaction depends on concentration, temperature, presence of catalyst and the physical state of reactants. A chemical reaction involves rearrangement of atoms so that old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed between different atoms. Intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole interactions and dispersion forces influence physical properties. Redox processes are analysed by assigning oxidation numbers and balancing the loss and gain of electrons. In aqueous solutions we frequently work with concepts like molarity, molality and mole fraction to express composition. Acid base theories provide different ways of identifying species that donate or accept protons or electron pairs. Equilibrium in a reversible reaction is described by an equilibrium constant that relates the activities of reactants and products.

Ecological relationships describe how populations of different species interact with each other and with their physical environment. Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life. The plasma membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell using a variety of transport mechanisms. Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. Enzymes act as biological catalysts by lowering the activation energy of biochemical reactions without being consumed. In multicellular organisms cells are organised into tissues, organs and organ systems that coordinate specific functions. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides within DNA molecules housed inside the nucleus or nucleoid region. Cellular respiration is a multi step process that gradually releases energy from glucose to synthesise ATP. Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy using pigment systems located in chloroplast membranes.

Newton's laws are used as a starting point to connect the net force on an object with its acceleration along a chosen axis. When friction is present the work done by the frictional force converts mechanical energy into internal energy or heat. In classical mechanics we describe motion by specifying position as a function of time and analysing the forces that act on the body. Energy methods provide an alternate way to solve problems by tracking kinetic and potential energy and using conservation principles. Often a complex situation is reduced to a set of coupled equations that are then solved algebraically or numerically. Free body diagrams are drawn to represent all the forces such as weight, normal reaction, tension and friction acting on the system. Momentum conservation is especially useful in analysing collisions between two or more bodies in isolated systems. In many examples we idealise surfaces as smooth and strings as light and inextensible in order to simplify the equations. For one dimensional motion with constant acceleration we often use kinematic relations between displacement, velocity and time. For circular motion we decompose acceleration into tangential and radial components, with the radial part pointing towards the centre.

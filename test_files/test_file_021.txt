Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there.

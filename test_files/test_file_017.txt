A function is a rule that assigns to each element of a domain exactly one element of a codomain. Integration is introduced as the inverse operation to differentiation and as a way to accumulate quantities. Basic differentiation rules allow us to compute derivatives of sums, products, quotients and compositions of functions. Sequences and series provide tools for approximating functions and for studying convergence behaviour. When studying limits we ask what value a function approaches as the input comes arbitrarily close to a given point. Definite integrals are connected to areas under curves when the integrand is non negative on a given interval. The derivative has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function. The derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient whenever this limit exists. Continuity at a point requires that the limit of the function at that point equals the value of the function there. Techniques such as substitution and integration by parts help evaluate more complicated integrals.

Evolution explains both the unity and diversity of life by proposing that species change over generations through natural selection. Homeostasis refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external change. Cells are considered the basic structural and functional units of living organisms across all kingdoms of life.","{""folder_label"": ""Biology"", ""description"": ""cell biology, evolutionary theory, natural selection, homeostasis, biological organization, organ systems"", ""keywords"": ""cells, evolution, tissues, organs, biology, life sciences""}"
